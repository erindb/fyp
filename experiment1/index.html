<div class="chain document002 chain0"><p>... We don't put reservations on tables, but people sometimes <span class="cloze document002 chain0 cloze0"> call in advance if they ’re with <span class="cloze document002 chain0 cloze1"> a large group </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document002 chain1"><p>... Being responsible for the place when the owner isn't there, I carry the restaurant's <span class="cloze document002 chain1 cloze0"> phone </span> with me while I work. It was after <span class="cloze document002 chain1 cloze1"> the lunch rush </span> when I get a phone call from a customer who ate at the restaurant a few days ago. It's not <span class="cloze document002 chain1 cloze2"> unusual </span> for us to get phone calls about reservations.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document002 chain2"><p>... Anyway, I thought it was <span class="cloze document002 chain2 cloze0"> one </span> of those calls, so I had already prepared a paper and a pen to <span class="cloze document002 chain2 cloze1"> write the order down </span>. Nope, it wasn't <span class="cloze document002 chain2 cloze2"> one </span> of those calls.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document002 chain3"><p>... Being responsible for the place when the owner isn't <span class="cloze document002 chain3 cloze0"> there </span>, I carry the restaurant's phone with me while I work.... She said that her young daughter had gotten ill after licking – yes licking – on one of the tables, and she wanted to talk to the owner. I told her I would give the owner her phone number so he could <span class="cloze document002 chain3 cloze1"> call her when he <span class="cloze document002 chain3 cloze2"> had the time to do so </span> </span>.... As promised, I <span class="cloze document002 chain3 cloze3"> gave the owner the phone number and told him about </span> the incident that the customer called about. He, along with myself and everyone else who works there, <span class="cloze document002 chain3 cloze4"> found it odd </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document002 chain4"><p>... It's not unusual for us to <span class="cloze document002 chain4 cloze0"> get phone calls about reservations </span>. We don't <span class="cloze document002 chain4 cloze1"> put reservations on tables </span>, but people sometimes call in advance if they ’re with a large group.... The customer called and asked how often we <span class="cloze document002 chain4 cloze2"> clean our <span class="cloze document002 chain4 cloze3"> tables </span> </span>.... I said we <span class="cloze document002 chain4 cloze4"> clean them off several times a day </span>, and <span class="cloze document002 chain4 cloze5"> ask why the customer is wondering this </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document002 chain5"><p>... I told her I would give the owner her phone number so </span> he could call her when he had the time to do so.... As promised, I <span class="cloze document002 chain5 cloze0"> gave the owner the phone number </span> and told him about the incident that the customer called about.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document002 chain6"><p>... The customer <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze0"> called </span> and <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze1"> asked how often we clean our tables </span>.... I said we clean them off several times a day, and ask why the customer is <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze2"> wondering this </span>. She <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze3"> said that her <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze4"> young daughter </span> had <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze5"> gotten ill after licking – yes </span> licking – on one of the tables </span>, and she <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze6"> wanted to talk to the owner </span>.

She <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze9"> agreed to that </span> and not much more was <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze10"> said </span>. As promised, I gave the owner the phone number and told him about the incident that the customer <span class="cloze document002 chain6 cloze11"> called about </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document002 chain7"><p> One day last summer I was <span class="cloze document002 chain7 cloze0"> working as usual at a seafood themed restaurant/pub </span>. Being responsible for the place when the owner isn't there, I <span class="cloze document002 chain7 cloze1"> carry the restaurant's phone with me while I <span class="cloze document002 chain7 cloze2"> work </span> </span>. It was after the lunch rush when I <span class="cloze document002 chain7 cloze3"> get a phone call from a customer who ate at the restaurant a few days ago </span>.... Anyway, I <span class="cloze document002 chain7 cloze4"> thought it was one of those calls, so I had already <span class="cloze document002 chain7 cloze5"> prepared a paper and a pen to write the order down </span> </span>....

I told her I would give the owner her phone number so </span> </span> he could call her when he had the time to do so.... As promised, I <span class="cloze document002 chain7 cloze7"> gave the owner the phone number </span> and told him about </span> the incident that the customer called about. He, along with myself and everyone else who works there, found it odd.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain0"><p>... The manager immediately apologized, saying that he was extremely sorry for what had happened and would refund our <span class="cloze document004 chain0 cloze0"> entire meat </span>, and took my card and bill to the waiter's station to make the changes. We never <span class="cloze document004 chain0 cloze1"> saw our <span class="cloze document004 chain0 cloze2"> waiter </span> again that evening, or on any future trip to the restaurant </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain1"><p>... My <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze0"> roommate </span> and I were <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze1"> grabbing some dinner one Friday night before meeting friends to have drinks out </span>.... At this point, I <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze2"> figured someone had to be messing with us </span>.... The waiter then came back with our checks and stood there (for the hundredth time) as I <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze3"> pulled out my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze4"> debit card </span> to pay </span>. I was <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze5"> covering the whole bill, as my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze6"> favorite NFL team </span> had been beaten by my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze7"> roommates </span> the previous week </span> and I was on <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze8"> the losing end </span> of our friendly wager.... I could <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze9"> see him <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze10"> swipe my card </span> a few times out of the corner of my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze11"> eye </span> </span>, and he looked confused.... Our waiter brought the check back to our table, and in the longest sentence he spoke all night, <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze12"> told me that he accidentally charged my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze13"> card </span> </span> FOUR TIMES for our bill. So my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze14"> ~ $ 50 total tab </span> had now deducted over $ 200 from my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze15"> account </span>. And then he WALKS AWAY leaving the bill at my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze16"> table </span>.... It was as if he thought I ’d just be <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze17"> fine with paying four times the amount </span> my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze18"> meal </span> should cost. I <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze19"> got up </span> and <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze20"> went over to the manager, who was chatting with a group of customers at another table </span>, and <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze21"> mentioned what happened </span>. The manager immediately apologized, saying that he was extremely sorry for what had happened and would refund our entire meat, and took my <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze22"> card and bill </span> to the waiter's station to make the changes.... That still tops the list as one of the weirdest dining experiences I ’ve ever <span class="cloze document004 chain1 cloze23"> had </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain2"><p>... No apology, no plan on how to <span class="cloze document004 chain2 cloze0"> solve this problem, nothing </span>. It <span class="cloze document004 chain2 cloze1"> was as if he thought I ’d just be fine with paying four times the amount my meal should cost </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain3"><p>... I was <span class="cloze document004 chain3 cloze0"> covering the whole bill, as my favorite NFL team had been beaten by my roommates the previous week </span> and I was on the losing end of our friendly wager. The waiter went back to the waiter's stand and <span class="cloze document004 chain3 cloze1"> ran the bill for about 10 minutes, which seemed like a long time seeing as it was all together on <span class="cloze document004 chain3 cloze2"> one check </span> </span>.... Our waiter brought the check back to our table, and in the longest sentence he spoke all night, told me that he accidentally charged my card FOUR TIMES for our bill.... And then he WALKS AWAY <span class="cloze document004 chain3 cloze3"> leaving the bill at my table </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain4"><p>... After a couple of more minutes of uncomfortable silent standing, the waiter turned and left to <span class="cloze document004 chain4 cloze0"> get our drinks from the bartender </span>. Surely, he wasn't going to continue to stand there … but once he <span class="cloze document004 chain4 cloze1"> brought back our drinks </span>, he went right back to standing right at the edge of the table.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain5"><p>... Mid-meal, he finally got another table assigned to him and we finally got a little bit of relief from his constant presence as he had another table to wait on and more orders to place. But after he had <span class="cloze document004 chain5 cloze0"> placed those orders </span> and served them <span class="cloze document004 chain5 cloze1"> drinks </span>, he came right back to our table to stand there.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain6"><p>... Looking around, there was only one other waiter … and it looked like she was <span class="cloze document004 chain6 cloze0"> pretty busy </span> working the four other tables she was <span class="cloze document004 chain6 cloze1"> assigned to </span>. She definitely wasn't <span class="cloze document004 chain6 cloze2"> concerned with what was happening on our end of the restaurant </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain7"><p>... The particular restaurant we <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze0"> were </span> at wasn't anything fancy or special, but had been around a while and had good prices on sushi and drinks. We were <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze1"> seated quickly at our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze2"> table </span> by the hostess </span>, and <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze3"> had a couple of minutes to look over the menu </span>, before the world's most awkward waiter came to take our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze4"> drink orders </span>. He came and stood by the table for two minutes before saying anything to either of us. We both <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze5"> said "hello" </span> and <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze6"> asked him "how's it going" </span> to no response. Finally after a minute longer of awkward standing, he acknowledged our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze7"> presence </span>. He <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze8"> told us it was his first day as a waiter </span> and we were <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze9"> his first solo table </span>.... After placing our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze10"> drink orders </span>, the waiter left to go and give them to the bartender, and then came right back to the table and stood there awkwardly without speaking to us. We were still <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze11"> looking over the menu to decide what we <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze12"> wanted </span>, so with his continued presence at the table we quickly <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze13"> made decisions thinking he was waiting on us to make up our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze14"> minds </span> </span> </span>.... We <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze15"> gave him both of our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze16"> orders </span> </span>, and he left again to go and place them in the kitchen without any sort of verbal affirmation or anything.... But, he was gone, so we didn't <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze17"> mind </span>. A couple of minutes later, our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze18"> waiter exits </span> from the kitchen and comes to stand – you guessed it – right next to our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze19"> table </span>. He doesn't say anything again, but just stands there in silence, looking at us and the other tables in the restaurant. After a couple of minutes, we <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze20"> decided to strike up a conversation with him to at least give him a reason to stand there </span>. He responded to all the questions we <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze21"> asked him </span> and <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze22"> talked for a bit </span>. Nothing seemed wrong with him, but for some reason he hovered next to our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze23"> table </span> like a moth to a light bulb. After we <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze24"> ran out of questions to ask him </span>, we <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze25"> tried to start talking to each other, hopefully indicating that it was time for him to go somewhere else and <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze26"> leave us alone for a little bit </span> </span>. After a couple of more minutes of uncomfortable silent standing, the waiter turned and left to get our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze27"> drinks </span> from the bartender. Surely, he wasn't going to continue to stand there … but once he brought back our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze28"> drinks </span>, he went right back to standing right at the edge of the table. After twenty more minutes of this, he turned and headed for the kitchen and brought our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze29"> meals </span> … which we <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze30"> ate under the uncomfortable watch of our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze31"> guard-waiter </span> </span>. Mid-meal, he finally got another table assigned to him and we finally <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze32"> got a little bit of relief from his constant presence as he had another table to wait on and more orders to place </span>. But after he had placed those orders and served them drinks, he came right back to our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze33"> table to stand there </span>. At this point, I figured someone had to be messing with us.... She definitely wasn't concerned with what was happening on our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze34"> end </span> of the restaurant. Once we were <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze35"> done (after eating pretty quickly) </span>, the waiter grabbed our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze36"> plates </span> without saying a word and headed back to the kitchen to drop them off. In the interim, the restaurant manager came over to our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze37"> table to <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze38"> ask us how he was doing </span> </span>. We <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze39"> told him he was doing well except for the fact that he liked to play the role of watchdog over our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze40"> table </span> </span>.... We <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze41"> told the manager it wasn't a big deal </span>. The waiter then came back with our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze42"> checks </span> and stood there (for the hundredth time) as I pulled out my debit card to pay. I was covering the whole bill, as my favorite NFL team had been beaten by my roommates the previous week and I was on the losing end of our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze43"> friendly wager </span>.... Our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze44"> waiter </span> brought the check back to our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze45"> table </span>, and in the longest sentence he spoke all night, told me that he accidentally charged my card FOUR TIMES for our <span class="cloze document004 chain7 cloze46"> bill </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain8"><p>... However, the restaurant was not <span class="cloze document004 chain8 cloze0"> very busy </span> and they had not <span class="cloze document004 chain8 cloze1"> put anyone else in his section (presumably to let him get his feet wet first before overloading him) </span>.... He doesn't say anything again, but just stands there in silence, looking at us and the other tables in the restaurant.... She definitely wasn't concerned with what was happening on our end of the restaurant.... We never saw our waiter again that evening, or on any future trip to the restaurant.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain9"><p>... Once we were done (after eating pretty quickly), the waiter <span class="cloze document004 chain9 cloze0"> grabbed our plates without saying a word </span> and headed back to the kitchen to <span class="cloze document004 chain9 cloze1"> drop them off </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain10"><p>... We <span class="cloze document004 chain10 cloze0"> gave him both of our orders </span>, and he left again to <span class="cloze document004 chain10 cloze1"> go and place them in the kitchen </span> without any sort of verbal affirmation or anything.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain11"><p>... He <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze0"> came </span> and <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze1"> stood by the table for two minutes before saying anything to either of us </span>. We both said "hello" and <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze2"> asked him "how's it going" </span> to no response. Finally after a minute longer of awkward standing, he <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze3"> acknowledged our presence </span>. He <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze4"> told us it was his <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze5"> first day </span> as a waiter </span> and we were his <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze6"> first solo table </span>.... After placing our drink orders, the waiter <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze7"> left to go and give them to the bartender </span>, and then <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze8"> came right back to the table </span> and stood there awkwardly without speaking to us. We were still looking over the menu to decide what we wanted, so with his <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze9"> continued presence </span> at the table we quickly made decisions thinking he was <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze10"> waiting on us to make up our minds </span>. However, the restaurant was not very busy and they had not put anyone else in his <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze11"> section </span> (presumably to let him <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze12"> get his <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze13"> feet </span> wet first </span> before <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze14"> overloading him </span>). We gave him both of our orders, and he <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze15"> left again to go and place them in the kitchen without any sort of verbal affirmation or anything </span>. Normally you expect the waiter to say something like, "I ’ll go and put your order in," </span> or "I ’m going to run and get this started for you," or "Bye, I ’m not going to stand here any longer." But, he was <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze16"> gone, so we didn't mind </span>.... He doesn't <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze17"> say anything again </span>, but <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze18"> just stands there in silence, looking at us and the other tables in the restaurant </span>.

The waiter <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze52"> went back to the waiter's <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze53"> stand </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze54"> ran the bill for about 10 minutes, which seemed like a long time seeing as it was all together on one check </span>. I could see him <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze55"> swipe my card </span> a few times out of the corner of my eye, and he <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze56"> looked confused </span>. He <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze57"> called the manager over </span> </span> and they stood and talked for a few minutes as the manager obviously was <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze58"> trying to <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze59"> instruct the waiter on something </span> </span>. Our waiter <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze60"> brought the check back to our table </span>, and in the longest sentence he <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze61"> spoke all night </span>, told me that he accidentally <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze62"> charged my card </span> FOUR TIMES for our bill.... And then he <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze63"> WALKS AWAY leaving the bill at my table </span>.... It was as if he <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze64"> thought I ’d just be fine with paying four times the amount </span> my meal should cost. I got up and went over to the manager, who was chatting with a group of customers at another table, and mentioned what happened. The manager immediately <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze65"> apologized, saying that he was <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze66"> extremely sorry for what had happened </span> and would <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze67"> refund our entire meat </span>, and <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze68"> took my card and bill to the waiter's <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze69"> station to make the changes </span> </span> </span>. We never <span class="cloze document004 chain11 cloze70"> saw our waiter again that evening, or on any future trip to the restaurant </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain12"><p>... Normally you expect the waiter to say something like, "I ’ll <span class="cloze document004 chain12 cloze0"> go and put your order in </span> </span>," </span> or "I ’m <span class="cloze document004 chain12 cloze1"> going to run and get this started for you </span>," or "Bye, I ’m not <span class="cloze document004 chain12 cloze2"> going to stand here any longer </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain13"><p>... We were seated quickly at our table by the hostess, and had a couple of minutes to look over the menu, before the world's most awkward waiter came to <span class="cloze document004 chain13 cloze0"> take our drink orders </span>.... After <span class="cloze document004 chain13 cloze1"> placing our drink orders </span>, the waiter left to <span class="cloze document004 chain13 cloze2"> go and give them to the bartender </span>, and then came right back to the table and stood there awkwardly without speaking to us.... We gave him both of our orders, and he left again to go and place them in the kitchen without any sort of verbal affirmation or anything.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document004 chain14"><p>... The waiter then came back with our checks and stood there (for the hundredth time) as I <span class="cloze document004 chain14 cloze0"> pulled out my debit card to pay </span>.... Our waiter brought the check back to our table, and in the longest sentence he spoke all night, told me that he accidentally <span class="cloze document004 chain14 cloze1"> charged my card </span> FOUR TIMES for our bill.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document008 chain0"><p>... We don't put reservations on tables, but people sometimes <span class="cloze document008 chain0 cloze0"> call in advance if they ’re with <span class="cloze document008 chain0 cloze1"> a large group </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document008 chain1"><p>... Being responsible for the place when the owner isn't there, I carry the restaurant's <span class="cloze document008 chain1 cloze0"> phone </span> with me while I work. It was after <span class="cloze document008 chain1 cloze1"> the lunch rush </span> when I get a phone call from a customer who ate at the restaurant a few days ago. It's not <span class="cloze document008 chain1 cloze2"> unusual </span> for us to get phone calls about reservations.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document008 chain2"><p>... Anyway, I thought it was <span class="cloze document008 chain2 cloze0"> one </span> of those calls, so I had already prepared a paper and a pen to <span class="cloze document008 chain2 cloze1"> write the order down </span>. Nope, it wasn't <span class="cloze document008 chain2 cloze2"> one </span> of those calls.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document008 chain3"><p>... Being responsible for the place when the owner isn't <span class="cloze document008 chain3 cloze0"> there </span>, I carry the restaurant's phone with me while I work.... She said that her young daughter had gotten ill after licking – yes licking – on one of the tables, and she wanted to talk to the owner. I told her I would give the owner her phone number so he could <span class="cloze document008 chain3 cloze1"> call her when he <span class="cloze document008 chain3 cloze2"> had the time to do so </span> </span>.... As promised, I <span class="cloze document008 chain3 cloze3"> gave the owner the phone number and told him about </span> the incident that the customer called about. He, along with myself and everyone else who works there, <span class="cloze document008 chain3 cloze4"> found it odd </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document008 chain4"><p>... It's not unusual for us to <span class="cloze document008 chain4 cloze0"> get phone calls about reservations </span>. We don't <span class="cloze document008 chain4 cloze1"> put reservations on tables </span>, but people sometimes call in advance if they ’re with a large group.... The customer called and asked how often we <span class="cloze document008 chain4 cloze2"> clean our <span class="cloze document008 chain4 cloze3"> tables </span> </span>.... I said we <span class="cloze document008 chain4 cloze4"> clean them off several times a day </span>, and <span class="cloze document008 chain4 cloze5"> ask why the customer is wondering this </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document008 chain5"><p>... I told her I would give the owner her phone number so </span> he could call her when he had the time to do so.... As promised, I <span class="cloze document008 chain5 cloze0"> gave the owner the phone number </span> and told him about the incident that the customer called about.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document008 chain6"><p>... The customer <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze0"> called </span> and <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze1"> asked how often we clean our tables </span>.... I said we clean them off several times a day, and ask why the customer is <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze2"> wondering this </span>. She <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze3"> said that her <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze4"> young daughter </span> had <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze5"> gotten ill after licking – yes </span> licking – on one of the tables </span>, and she <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze6"> wanted to talk to the owner </span>. I told her I would give the owner her <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze7"> phone number </span> so </span> he could <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze8"> call her when he had the time to do so </span>. She <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze9"> agreed to that </span> and not much more was <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze10"> said </span>. As promised, I gave the owner the phone number and told him about the incident that the customer <span class="cloze document008 chain6 cloze11"> called about </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document008 chain7"><p> One day last summer I was <span class="cloze document008 chain7 cloze0"> working as usual at a seafood themed restaurant/pub </span>. Being responsible for the place when the owner isn't there, I <span class="cloze document008 chain7 cloze1"> carry the restaurant's phone with me while I <span class="cloze document008 chain7 cloze2"> work </span> </span>. It was after the lunch rush when I <span class="cloze document008 chain7 cloze3"> get a phone call from a customer who ate at the restaurant a few days ago </span>.... Anyway, I <span class="cloze document008 chain7 cloze4"> thought it was one of those calls, so I had already <span class="cloze document008 chain7 cloze5"> prepared a paper and a pen to write the order down </span> </span>....

He, along with myself and everyone else who works there, found it odd.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain0"><p>... The manager immediately apologized, saying that he was extremely sorry for what had happened and would refund our <span class="cloze document010 chain0 cloze0"> entire meat </span>, and took my card and bill to the waiter's station to make the changes. We never <span class="cloze document010 chain0 cloze1"> saw our <span class="cloze document010 chain0 cloze2"> waiter </span> again that evening, or on any future trip to the restaurant </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain1"><p>... My <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze0"> roommate </span> and I were <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze1"> grabbing some dinner one Friday night before meeting friends to have drinks out </span>.... At this point, I <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze2"> figured someone had to be messing with us </span>.... The waiter then came back with our checks and stood there (for the hundredth time) as I <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze3"> pulled out my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze4"> debit card </span> to pay </span>. I was <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze5"> covering the whole bill, as my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze6"> favorite NFL team </span> had been beaten by my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze7"> roommates </span> the previous week </span> and I was on <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze8"> the losing end </span> of our friendly wager.... I could <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze9"> see him <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze10"> swipe my card </span> a few times out of the corner of my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze11"> eye </span> </span>, and he looked confused.... Our waiter brought the check back to our table, and in the longest sentence he spoke all night, <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze12"> told me that he accidentally charged my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze13"> card </span> </span> FOUR TIMES for our bill. So my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze14"> ~ $ 50 total tab </span> had now deducted over $ 200 from my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze15"> account </span>. And then he WALKS AWAY leaving the bill at my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze16"> table </span>.... It was as if he thought I ’d just be <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze17"> fine with paying four times the amount </span> my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze18"> meal </span> should cost. I <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze19"> got up </span> and <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze20"> went over to the manager, who was chatting with a group of customers at another table </span>, and <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze21"> mentioned what happened </span>. The manager immediately apologized, saying that he was extremely sorry for what had happened and would refund our entire meat, and took my <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze22"> card and bill </span> to the waiter's station to make the changes.... That still tops the list as one of the weirdest dining experiences I ’ve ever <span class="cloze document010 chain1 cloze23"> had </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain2"><p>... No apology, no plan on how to <span class="cloze document010 chain2 cloze0"> solve this problem, nothing </span>. It <span class="cloze document010 chain2 cloze1"> was as if he thought I ’d just be fine with paying four times the amount my meal should cost </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain3"><p>... I was <span class="cloze document010 chain3 cloze0"> covering the whole bill, as my favorite NFL team had been beaten by my roommates the previous week </span> and I was on the losing end of our friendly wager. The waiter went back to the waiter's stand and <span class="cloze document010 chain3 cloze1"> ran the bill for about 10 minutes, which seemed like a long time seeing as it was all together on <span class="cloze document010 chain3 cloze2"> one check </span> </span>.... Our waiter brought the check back to our table, and in the longest sentence he spoke all night, told me that he accidentally charged my card FOUR TIMES for our bill.... And then he WALKS AWAY <span class="cloze document010 chain3 cloze3"> leaving the bill at my table </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain4"><p>... After a couple of more minutes of uncomfortable silent standing, the waiter turned and left to <span class="cloze document010 chain4 cloze0"> get our drinks from the bartender </span>. Surely, he wasn't going to continue to stand there … but once he <span class="cloze document010 chain4 cloze1"> brought back our drinks </span>, he went right back to standing right at the edge of the table.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain5"><p>... Mid-meal, he finally got another table assigned to him and we finally got a little bit of relief from his constant presence as he had another table to wait on and more orders to place. But after he had <span class="cloze document010 chain5 cloze0"> placed those orders </span> and served them <span class="cloze document010 chain5 cloze1"> drinks </span>, he came right back to our table to stand there.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain6"><p>... Looking around, there was only one other waiter … and it looked like she was <span class="cloze document010 chain6 cloze0"> pretty busy </span> working the four other tables she was <span class="cloze document010 chain6 cloze1"> assigned to </span>. She definitely wasn't <span class="cloze document010 chain6 cloze2"> concerned with what was happening on our end of the restaurant </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain7"><p>... The particular restaurant we <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze0"> were </span> at wasn't anything fancy or special, but had been around a while and had good prices on sushi and drinks. We were <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze1"> seated quickly at our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze2"> table </span> by the hostess </span>, and <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze3"> had a couple of minutes to look over the menu </span>, before the world's most awkward waiter came to take our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze4"> drink orders </span>. He came and stood by the table for two minutes before saying anything to either of us. We both <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze5"> said "hello" </span> and <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze6"> asked him "how's it going" </span> to no response. Finally after a minute longer of awkward standing, he acknowledged our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze7"> presence </span>. He <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze8"> told us it was his first day as a waiter </span> and we were <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze9"> his first solo table </span>.... After placing our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze10"> drink orders </span>, the waiter left to go and give them to the bartender, and then came right back to the table and stood there awkwardly without speaking to us. We were still <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze11"> looking over the menu to decide what we <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze12"> wanted </span>, so with his continued presence at the table we quickly <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze13"> made decisions thinking he was waiting on us to make up our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze14"> minds </span> </span> </span>.... We <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze15"> gave him both of our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze16"> orders </span> </span>, and he left again to go and place them in the kitchen without any sort of verbal affirmation or anything.... But, he was gone, so we didn't <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze17"> mind </span>. A couple of minutes later, our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze18"> waiter exits </span> from the kitchen and comes to stand – you guessed it – right next to our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze19"> table </span>. He doesn't say anything again, but just stands there in silence, looking at us and the other tables in the restaurant. After a couple of minutes, we <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze20"> decided to strike up a conversation with him to at least give him a reason to stand there </span>. He responded to all the questions we <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze21"> asked him </span> and <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze22"> talked for a bit </span>. Nothing seemed wrong with him, but for some reason he hovered next to our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze23"> table </span> like a moth to a light bulb. After we <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze24"> ran out of questions to ask him </span>, we <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze25"> tried to start talking to each other, hopefully indicating that it was time for him to go somewhere else and <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze26"> leave us alone for a little bit </span> </span>. After a couple of more minutes of uncomfortable silent standing, the waiter turned and left to get our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze27"> drinks </span> from the bartender. Surely, he wasn't going to continue to stand there … but once he brought back our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze28"> drinks </span>, he went right back to standing right at the edge of the table. After twenty more minutes of this, he turned and headed for the kitchen and brought our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze29"> meals </span> … which we <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze30"> ate under the uncomfortable watch of our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze31"> guard-waiter </span> </span>. Mid-meal, he finally got another table assigned to him and we finally <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze32"> got a little bit of relief from his constant presence as he had another table to wait on and more orders to place </span>. But after he had placed those orders and served them drinks, he came right back to our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze33"> table to stand there </span>. At this point, I figured someone had to be messing with us.... She definitely wasn't concerned with what was happening on our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze34"> end </span> of the restaurant. Once we were <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze35"> done (after eating pretty quickly) </span>, the waiter grabbed our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze36"> plates </span> without saying a word and headed back to the kitchen to drop them off. In the interim, the restaurant manager came over to our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze37"> table to <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze38"> ask us how he was doing </span> </span>. We <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze39"> told him he was doing well except for the fact that he liked to play the role of watchdog over our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze40"> table </span> </span>.... We <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze41"> told the manager it wasn't a big deal </span>. The waiter then came back with our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze42"> checks </span> and stood there (for the hundredth time) as I pulled out my debit card to pay. I was covering the whole bill, as my favorite NFL team had been beaten by my roommates the previous week and I was on the losing end of our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze43"> friendly wager </span>.... Our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze44"> waiter </span> brought the check back to our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze45"> table </span>, and in the longest sentence he spoke all night, told me that he accidentally charged my card FOUR TIMES for our <span class="cloze document010 chain7 cloze46"> bill </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain8"><p>... However, the restaurant was not <span class="cloze document010 chain8 cloze0"> very busy </span> and they had not <span class="cloze document010 chain8 cloze1"> put anyone else in his section (presumably to let him get his feet wet first before overloading him) </span>.... He doesn't say anything again, but just stands there in silence, looking at us and the other tables in the restaurant.... She definitely wasn't concerned with what was happening on our end of the restaurant.... We never saw our waiter again that evening, or on any future trip to the restaurant.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain9"><p>... Once we were done (after eating pretty quickly), the waiter <span class="cloze document010 chain9 cloze0"> grabbed our plates without saying a word </span> and headed back to the kitchen to <span class="cloze document010 chain9 cloze1"> drop them off </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain10"><p>...

However, the restaurant was not very busy and they had not put anyone else in his <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze11"> section </span> (presumably to let him <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze12"> get his <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze13"> feet </span> wet first </span> before <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze14"> overloading him </span>).

In the interim, the restaurant manager <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze41"> came over to our table to ask us how he was <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze42"> doing </span> </span>. We <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze43"> told him he was <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze44"> doing well except for the fact that he <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze45"> liked to play the role of watchdog over our table </span> </span> </span>. The manager <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze46"> apologized </span> and <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze47"> said that he ’d <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze48"> talk with him later about it </span> </span>. We <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze49"> told the manager it wasn't a big deal </span>. The waiter then <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze50"> came back with our checks </span> and <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze51"> stood there (for the hundredth time) as I pulled out my debit card to pay </span>.... The waiter <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze52"> went back to the waiter's <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze53"> stand </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze54"> ran the bill for about 10 minutes, which seemed like a long time seeing as it was all together on one check </span>. I could see him <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze55"> swipe my card </span> a few times out of the corner of my eye, and he <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze56"> looked confused </span>. He <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze57"> called the manager over </span> </span> and they stood and talked for a few minutes as the manager obviously was <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze58"> trying to <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze59"> instruct the waiter on something </span> </span>. Our waiter <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze60"> brought the check back to our table </span>, and in the longest sentence he <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze61"> spoke all night </span>, told me that he accidentally <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze62"> charged my card </span> FOUR TIMES for our bill.... And then he <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze63"> WALKS AWAY leaving the bill at my table </span>.... It was as if he <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze64"> thought I ’d just be fine with paying four times the amount </span> my meal should cost. I got up and went over to the manager, who was chatting with a group of customers at another table, and mentioned what happened. The manager immediately <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze65"> apologized, saying that he was <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze66"> extremely sorry for what had happened </span> and would <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze67"> refund our entire meat </span>, and <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze68"> took my card and bill to the waiter's <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze69"> station to make the changes </span> </span> </span>. We never <span class="cloze document010 chain11 cloze70"> saw our waiter again that evening, or on any future trip to the restaurant </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain12"><p>... Normally you expect the waiter to say something like, "I ’ll <span class="cloze document010 chain12 cloze0"> go and put your order in </span> </span>," </span> or "I ’m <span class="cloze document010 chain12 cloze1"> going to run and get this started for you </span>," or "Bye, I ’m not <span class="cloze document010 chain12 cloze2"> going to stand here any longer </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain13"><p>... We were seated quickly at our table by the hostess, and had a couple of minutes to look over the menu, before the world's most awkward waiter came to <span class="cloze document010 chain13 cloze0"> take our drink orders </span>.... After <span class="cloze document010 chain13 cloze1"> placing our drink orders </span>, the waiter left to <span class="cloze document010 chain13 cloze2"> go and give them to the bartender </span>, and then came right back to the table and stood there awkwardly without speaking to us.... We gave him both of our orders, and he left again to go and place them in the kitchen without any sort of verbal affirmation or anything.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document010 chain14"><p>... The waiter then came back with our checks and stood there (for the hundredth time) as I <span class="cloze document010 chain14 cloze0"> pulled out my debit card to pay </span>.... Our waiter brought the check back to our table, and in the longest sentence he spoke all night, told me that he accidentally <span class="cloze document010 chain14 cloze1"> charged my card </span> FOUR TIMES for our bill.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document012 chain0"><p>... At the 15 minute mark we sawÂ her <span class="cloze document012 chain0 cloze0"> look </span> at us while trying to flag her down, then turn on her <span class="cloze document012 chain0 cloze1"> heels </span> and go into the kitchen. At 20 minutes we watch her <span class="cloze document012 chain0 cloze2"> walk </span> out of the restaurant while on her <span class="cloze document012 chain0 cloze3"> cell phone </span>. The other waitress <span class="cloze document012 chain0 cloze4"> went as far as to ignore us as we called out to her <span class="cloze document012 chain0 cloze5"> just </span> so we could get our drinks </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document012 chain1"><p> My boyfriend and I <span class="cloze document012 chain1 cloze0"> attempted to eat at a restaurant we used to frequent when we first started dating </span>.... So after a half hour my boyfriend and I <span class="cloze document012 chain1 cloze1"> decide we ’ve waited long enough and got up to leave </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document012 chain2"><p> My boyfriend and I <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze0"> attempted to eat at a restaurant we <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze1"> used to frequent when we first <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze2"> started dating </span> </span> </span> </span>. We <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze3"> went for lunch </span>. They were pretty slow ; just an elderly couple, a family with a baby, and another couple who came in with us. When we <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze4"> went in we </span> were told to sit wherever we <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze5"> wanted </span>, so we <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze6"> sat in full view of the staff </span>. TenÂ minutes in and we had <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze7"> watched our <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze8"> waitress chat </span> with the elderly couple </span> and <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze9"> play with the baby </span>. At the 15 minute mark we <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze10"> sawÂ her look at us while trying to flag her down, then turn on her heels and go into the kitchen </span>. At 20 minutes we <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze11"> watch her walk out of the restaurant while on her cell phone </span>. The other waitress went as far as to <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze12"> ignore us as we <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze13"> called out to her just so we could <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze14"> get our <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze15"> drinks </span> </span> </span> </span>. So after a half hour my boyfriend and I <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze16"> decide we ’ve <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze17"> waited long enough </span> and <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze18"> got up to leave </span> </span> </span>. As we ’re <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze19"> walking out the cashier </span> <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze20"> stops us </span> and <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze21"> tells us that we <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze22"> need to pay </span> </span>, to which I pointed out we didn't <span class="cloze document012 chain2 cloze23"> get anything </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document012 chain3"><p> My <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze0"> boyfriend </span> and I <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze1"> attempted to eat at a restaurant we used to frequent when we first started dating </span>.... So after a half hour my <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze2"> boyfriend </span> and I <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze3"> decide we ’ve waited long enough and got up to leave </span>. As we ’re walking out the cashier stops us and tells us that we need to pay, to which I <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze4"> pointed out we didn't get anything </span>. I ’m then <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze5"> told that they heard me <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze6"> ask for drinks </span> </span>. I <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze7"> told them if I had even <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze8"> gotten that then they ’d have my <span class="cloze document012 chain3 cloze9"> patronage </span> </span> </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document012 chain4"><p>... I ’m then told that they <span class="cloze document012 chain4 cloze0"> heard me ask for drinks </span>. I <span class="cloze document012 chain4 cloze1"> told them if I had even gotten that then they ’d <span class="cloze document012 chain4 cloze2"> have my patronage </span> </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain0"><p>... I always volunteered because it was easy money and the tips were always <span class="cloze document013 chain0 cloze0"> good </span>. Plus they always <span class="cloze document013 chain0 cloze1"> had extra food </span> and the staff got to eat for free.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain1"><p> Back in the 80's I <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze0"> worked at a hotel and casino in Reno that also was home to a male </span> only club made up of a who's who of business leaders and politicians.... My <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze1"> work shift </span> was split between serving breakfast as a room service waiter, and serving lunch in the private club. Occasionally the club had evening "stag" parties and my <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze2"> boss </span> would ask for volunteers to work the parties. I always <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze3"> volunteered because it was easy money and the tips were always good </span>.... It was a hot summer day and I was <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze4"> looking forward to working the stag party that night </span>.... <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze5"> As I was getting ready to make the move from room service </span> to club service, my <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze6"> boss </span> <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze7"> called me and two other waiters over for a meeting in our storage room </span>.... You ’d think that would be the end to my <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze8"> story </span>, but it's not.... The D.A. <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze9"> sat in my <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze10"> section </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze11"> informed me that he had <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze12"> placed a standing order with "John" </span> </span> </span> our bartender. So whenever a glass was at or near empty I <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze13"> was to go over and get a refill </span>. He told me that </span> </span> "he ’d <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze14"> take care of me" if I <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze15"> did that </span> </span>.... As the evening progressed the D.A. <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze16"> started to get louder when he <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze17"> talked </span> and his <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze18"> speech </span> slurred </span>, and he <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze19"> began buying drinks for everyone </span>.... So we started to brew the coffee when suddenly the D.A. <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze20"> stood up </span> and <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze21"> called for the room to quiet </span> down because he <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze22"> had something to say </span>. The first thing that <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze23"> struck me </span> was that his <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze24"> speech </span> was clear and strong with no sign of the previous alcohol-induced swagger. As the room quieted down and the membership turned to listen, I <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze25"> got the sudden feeling that something was very, very, wrong </span>. He <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze26"> said, "I <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze27"> hope you ’ve all had a good evening </span> </span>. We ’ve <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze28"> all had an incredible meal, and I know that more than a few of you </span> have enjoyed the drinks I ’ve <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze29"> bought you </span>." This brought chuckles and smiles since he was <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze30"> known to be very tight-fisted </span>. "So I <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze31"> hope you ’ll <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze32"> forgive me for leaving early but duty calls </span> </span>. There is a drunk driving roadblock set up and I <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze33"> have to be there </span>."... One of the members called out asking where the roadblock was so that he could <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze34"> steer clear when he <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze35"> left </span> </span>.... At which he simply <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze36"> walked out </span>.... At this point panic set in as we found out from "John" that all the D.A. had been <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze37"> drinking that night </span> was cola.... He hadn't <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze38"> had any alcohol all night </span> and his <span class="cloze document013 chain1 cloze39"> actions </span> were an act. </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain2"><p>... Occasionally the club <span class="cloze document013 chain2 cloze0"> had evening "stag" parties </span> and my boss would ask for volunteers to <span class="cloze document013 chain2 cloze1"> work the parties </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain3"><p>... We had heard about the menu being served – whole Maine lobsters <span class="cloze document013 chain3 cloze0"> split </span> and <span class="cloze document013 chain3 cloze1"> roasted </span> with drawn butter – and that the lobsters were being <span class="cloze document013 chain3 cloze2"> flown in live having been caught that morning </span>.... He looked panicked and told us that due to some snafu at the airport, the 200 lobsters for the party tonight were <span class="cloze document013 chain3 cloze3"> left out in the hot Nevada sun on a loading dock </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain4"><p>... As it neared 10pm, things were starting to slow down and the word was passed that we should <span class="cloze document013 chain4 cloze0"> start to push coffee and slow down on the alcohol service </span>. So we <span class="cloze document013 chain4 cloze1"> started to brew the coffee when suddenly the D.A. stood up and called for the room to quiet down because he had something to say </span>.... At this point panic set in as we <span class="cloze document013 chain4 cloze2"> found out from "John" that all the D.A. had been drinking that night </span> was cola.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain5"><p>... He said, "I hope you <span class="cloze document013 chain5 cloze0"> ’ve all had a good evening </span>. We ’ve all had an incredible meal, and I know that more than a few of you have enjoyed the drinks I ’ve <span class="cloze document013 chain5 cloze1"> bought you </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain6"><p>... There <span class="cloze document013 chain6 cloze0"> is a drunk driving roadblock set up </span> and I have to be there."...

<div class="chain document013 chain8"><p>... Plus they always had extra food and the staff <span class="cloze document013 chain8 cloze0"> got to eat for free </span>.... The members were told of the snafu and how the wait staff had <span class="cloze document013 chain8 cloze1"> rallied to save the day </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain9"><p>... It was a hot summer day and I was looking forward to <span class="cloze document013 chain9 cloze0"> working the stag party that night </span>.... And with no time to have 200 more caught and flown out for the party, he was asking us to run around town to every place that had a lobster tank and buy everything they had.... Fast forward to the party.... The party <span class="cloze document013 chain9 cloze1"> started on a good note </span>.... A couple of hours into the party no one was feeling any pain and everyone was happy.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain10"><p>... You ’d think that would be <span class="cloze document013 chain10 cloze0"> the end </span> to my story, but it <span class="cloze document013 chain10 cloze1">'s not </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain11"><p>... Occasionally the club had evening "stag" parties and my boss would <span class="cloze document013 chain11 cloze0"> ask for volunteers to work the parties </span>.... As I was getting ready to make the move from room service to club service, my boss <span class="cloze document013 chain11 cloze1"> called me and two other waiters over for a meeting in our storage room </span>. He <span class="cloze document013 chain11 cloze2"> looked panicked </span> and <span class="cloze document013 chain11 cloze3"> told us that due to some snafu at the airport, the 200 lobsters for the party tonight were left out in the hot Nevada sun on a loading dock </span>....

<div class="chain document013 chain12"><p>... "It's outside <span class="cloze document013 chain12 cloze0"> this hotel </span> for a two block radius. So drink up, the city <span class="cloze document013 chain12 cloze1"> needs the money </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain13"><p>... We had <span class="cloze document013 chain13 cloze0"> heard about the menu being served </span> – whole Maine lobsters split and roasted with drawn butter – and that the lobsters were being flown in live having been caught that morning. As I was getting ready to make the move from room service to club service, my boss called me and two other waiters over for a meeting in our <span class="cloze document013 chain13 cloze1"> storage room </span>. He looked panicked and <span class="cloze document013 chain13 cloze2"> told us that due to some snafu at the airport, the 200 lobsters for the party tonight were left out in the hot Nevada sun on a loading dock </span>. Our "live" lobsters were now dead and smelling badly. And with no time to have 200 more caught and <span class="cloze document013 chain13 cloze3"> flown out for the party, he was asking us to run around town to every place that had </span> a lobster tank and buy everything they had. Two hours later, there wasn't a live lobster anywhere in town except in our <span class="cloze document013 chain13 cloze4"> cooler </span>.... The D.A. sat in my section and informed me that he had placed a standing order with "John" our <span class="cloze document013 chain13 cloze5"> bartender </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain14"><p>... This was totally out of <span class="cloze document013 chain14 cloze0"> character </span> but no one seemed to care.... As it <span class="cloze document013 chain14 cloze1"> neared 10pm </span>, things were starting to slow down and the word was passed that we should start to push coffee and slow down on the alcohol service.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document013 chain15"><p>...

<div class="chain document015 chain0"><p>... This was a few years ago so I ’m not sure if this lady still <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze0"> works at this particular restaurant </span>, but always better safe than sorry.... Our server was a lady who, if you remember the television show Alice, resembled Flo in eerie detail, right down to her <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze1"> Aqua-Net helmet hair </span>. It was kind of fun, because normally you would see someone like her at a time-warp-type of restaurant in the movie theme park, so we figured she was <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze2"> a straggler </span> or a floater. The first question out of her <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze3"> mouth </span> was, "Are you on the dining plan?", and when we answered "yes" her <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze4"> eyes </span> rolled up so fast I ’m sure she was <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze5"> staring at her <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze6"> brain </span> </span>.... We <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze7"> saw this woman twice more : once when she <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze8"> took our order </span> and once when she <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze9"> took our check </span> </span>.... She finally <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze10"> showed up about seventy-five minutes into our trip to the Twilight Zone, only to spend another ten minutes pin trading (trading colorful pins with patrons) with a man and his wife at another server's table </span>. The server actually had to <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze11"> run her off </span> ! She barely <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze12"> acknowledged us as she <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze13"> pulled out our tab </span> </span>, and much like Forrest Gump's <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze14"> feather </span> it floated onto our table as she had already <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze15"> become a ghost </span>.... When she <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze16"> stopped by to pick up the bill </span> we <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze17"> asked her about it </span>. She snottily <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze18"> replied, "It's automatic when you dine on the dining plan </span>."... I wanted to feel badly about it, but when I realized the lady basically <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze19"> STOLE from us that urge to feel sympathetic to her <span class="cloze document015 chain0 cloze20"> plight </span> didn't last </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document015 chain1"><p>... As we stared at the slip we <span class="cloze document015 chain1 cloze0"> noticed an 18 % auto-grat on the bill </span>.... We learned later that we weren't supposed to be <span class="cloze document015 chain1 cloze1"> charged the auto-grat </span> and the tip was returned to our credit card.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document015 chain2"><p>... The first question out of her mouth was, "Are you on the dining plan?"... I know it's typical for diners to <span class="cloze document015 chain2 cloze0"> treat the plan as a cover-all and not tip </span>, but that's not us.... She snottily replied, "It's automatic when you dine on the dining plan." We almost resigned ourselves to <span class="cloze document015 chain2 cloze1"> paying it </span> and ending this weird experience as quickly as possible. Still, something didn't seem right about it.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document015 chain3"><p>... She barely acknowledged us as she <span class="cloze document015 chain3 cloze0"> pulled out our tab </span>, and much like Forrest Gump's feather it <span class="cloze document015 chain3 cloze1"> floated onto our table as she had already become a ghost </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document015 chain4"><p>... This was a few years ago so I ’m not <span class="cloze document015 chain4 cloze0"> sure </span> if this lady still works at this particular restaurant, but always better safe than sorry.... I <span class="cloze document015 chain4 cloze1"> know it's typical for diners to treat the plan as a cover-all and not tip </span>, but that's not us.... We filled out the receipt, putting a "0" in the tip section as I already <span class="cloze document015 chain4 cloze2"> felt like we over-tipped </span>. But something stuck in my <span class="cloze document015 chain4 cloze3"> mind </span> on the way out, enough to request a manager from the hostess table.... I <span class="cloze document015 chain4 cloze4"> wanted to feel badly about it, but when I <span class="cloze document015 chain4 cloze5"> realized the lady basically STOLE from us that urge to feel sympathetic to her plight didn't last </span> </span>. I <span class="cloze document015 chain4 cloze6"> do wish we could have left something for the runner who fed us, though </span>.... </p></div>

It was <span class="cloze document015 chain5 cloze1"> kind </span> of fun, because normally you would see someone like her at a time-warp-type of restaurant in the movie theme park, so we figured she was a straggler or a floater.... After waiting forty-five minutes for our orders to come through, we had to stop another server and tell them we couldn't <span class="cloze document015 chain5 cloze2"> find our server or our food </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document015 chain6"><p>... After waiting forty-five minutes for our orders to come through, we had to <span class="cloze document015 chain6 cloze0"> stop another server </span> and tell them we couldn't find our server or our food. Another runner <span class="cloze document015 chain6 cloze1"> brought it out immediately </span>, unfortunately a little chilled, along with our only refill of the evening, but still no Flo. She finally showed up about seventy-five minutes into our trip to the Twilight Zone, only to spend another ten minutes pin trading (trading colorful pins with patrons) with a man and his wife at another server's <span class="cloze document015 chain6 cloze2"> table </span>. The server actually <span class="cloze document015 chain6 cloze3"> had to run her off </span> !... </p></div>

<div class="chain document015 chain7"><p>... It was our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze0"> first night </span> at a certain mousy venue, and we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze1"> decided to leave the kids with the grandparents at the hotel </span> and <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze2"> have one romantic dinner together for our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze3"> anniversary </span> </span>. So we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze4"> head over to an Italian joint in the aforementioned theme park, and the hostess who seated us <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze5"> put us into one of the nicest tables at the restaurant in honor of our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze6"> anniversary </span> </span> </span> </span>.... Our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze7"> server </span> was a lady who, if you remember the television show Alice, resembled Flo in eerie detail, right down to her Aqua-Net helmet hair. It was kind of fun, because normally you would see someone like her at a time-warp-type of restaurant in the movie theme park, so we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze8"> figured she was a straggler or a floater </span>...., and when we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze9"> answered "yes" her eyes </span> rolled up so fast I ’m sure she was staring at her brain. I know it's typical for diners to treat the plan as a cover-all and not tip, but that's not us.... We <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze10"> saw this woman twice more : once when she took our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze11"> order </span> and once when she took our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze12"> check </span> </span>. After waiting forty-five minutes for our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze13"> orders to come through </span>, we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze14"> had to stop another server and tell them we couldn't <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze15"> find our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze16"> server </span> or our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze17"> food </span> </span> </span>. Another runner brought it out immediately, unfortunately a little chilled, along with our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze18"> only refill </span> of the evening, but still no Flo. She finally showed up about seventy-five minutes into our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze19"> trip </span> to the Twilight Zone, only to spend another ten minutes pin trading (trading colorful pins with patrons) with a man and his wife at another server's table.... She barely <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze20"> acknowledged us as she pulled out our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze21"> tab </span> </span>, and much like Forrest Gump's feather it floated onto our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze22"> table </span> as she had already become a ghost. As we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze23"> stared at the slip </span> we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze24"> noticed an 18 % auto-grat on the bill </span>. When she stopped by to pick up the bill we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze25"> asked her about it </span>.... We almost <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze26"> resigned ourselves to paying it and ending this weird experience as quickly as possible </span> </span>.... We <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze27"> filled out the receipt, putting a "0" in the tip section as I already felt like we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze28"> over-tipped </span> </span>.... The manager took one look at our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze29"> bill </span> and asked, "Were there six people at your table?" which of course we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze30"> said no </span>. He then got this very perturbed look <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze31"> on his face, asked us if he could offer us anything for the mix-up, </span> which we <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze32"> declined </span>, and <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze33"> told us he would make it right </span>. We <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze34"> learned later that we weren't <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze35"> supposed to be charged the auto-grat </span> </span> and the tip was returned to our <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze36"> credit card </span>. I wanted to feel badly about it, but when I realized the lady basically STOLE from us that urge to feel sympathetic to her plight didn't last. I do wish we could have <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze37"> left something for the runner who <span class="cloze document015 chain7 cloze38"> fed us, though </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document015 chain8"><p>... But something stuck in my mind on the way out, enough to <span class="cloze document015 chain8 cloze0"> request a manager from the hostess table </span>. The manager <span class="cloze document015 chain8 cloze1"> took one look at our bill </span> and <span class="cloze document015 chain8 cloze2"> asked, "Were there six people at your table </span>?"... He then <span class="cloze document015 chain8 cloze3"> got this very perturbed look <span class="cloze document015 chain8 cloze4"> on his <span class="cloze document015 chain8 cloze5"> face </span> </span>, asked <span class="cloze document015 chain8 cloze6"> us if he could offer us anything for the mix-up, </span> </span> which we declined, and <span class="cloze document015 chain8 cloze7"> told us he would <span class="cloze document015 chain8 cloze8"> make it right </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document017 chain0"><p>... The father was <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze0"> the sweetest man </span> you could ever meet. He was <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze1"> our dishwasher </span>. His <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze2"> oldest son </span> mainly <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze3"> cooked, while the youngest son, Tim, was <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze4"> the general manager </span> </span> </span>. Now Tim was <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze5"> a piece </span> of work. He <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze6"> opened </span>, <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze7"> stayed through lunch </span>, <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze8"> had his <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze9"> break </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze10"> then usually showed up </span> halfway through dinner. There was no problem with that except nobody could clock in because you needed a manager code, which he <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze11"> refused to give to any server </span>. There was also no "head server" to make decisions when he <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze12"> wasn't there </span>.... Tim also <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze13"> had a thing for young servers </span>. He was <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze14"> 24 </span>, which is too young to be running a restaurant in my opinion. But he <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze15"> looked over experienced servers </span> and <span class="cloze document017 chain0 cloze16"> instead hired servers who were under 18 and had no experience, only because they were good looking </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document017 chain1"><p>... There was no problem with that except nobody could clock in because you <span class="cloze document017 chain1 cloze0"> needed a manager code, which he refused to give to any server </span>.... It mostly <span class="cloze document017 chain1 cloze1"> went by seniority </span>.... It had <span class="cloze document017 chain1 cloze2"> gotten to a point where I had to give the cooks a handwritten ticket, add the bill and figure tax manually, and give customers a handwritten bill on receipt paper </span>. It <span class="cloze document017 chain1 cloze3"> looked horribly unprofessional </span> and I always felt awful about it.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document017 chain2"><p>... Servers were without their <span class="cloze document017 chain2 cloze0"> last two paychecks </span>, any credit <span class="cloze document017 chain2 cloze1"> card tips </span> from the last month, and without a job.Â I ’m just glad I got out while I did. </p></div>

<div class="chain document017 chain3"><p>... Both had worked there for 2 weeks, were 16 and had never <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze0"> had a serving job before </span>. They <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze1"> closed the restaurant that weekend because they <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze2"> had no staff </span>, but <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze3"> reopened </span> shortly afterwards </span>. About two months later, they <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze4"> went out of business </span>. Not only did they not <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze5"> tell their <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze6"> employees </span> </span>, they simply <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze7"> packed up one night after close </span>, <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze8"> changed the locks </span> and <span class="cloze document017 chain3 cloze9"> left town </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document017 chain4"><p> I <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze0"> used to work in an Italian restaurant in a small midwestern town </span>.... It had gotten to a point where I <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze1"> had to give the cooks a handwritten ticket, add the bill and figure tax manually, and give customers a handwritten bill on receipt paper </span>. It looked horribly unprofessional and I always <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze2"> felt awful about it </span>.... He was 24, which is too young to be running a restaurant in my <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze3"> opinion </span>.... It's a little creepy if you <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze4"> ask me </span>. But most nights, I would be <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze5"> the only server </span> old enough to serve alcohol, so on top of <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze6"> all my tables </span>, I was also <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze7"> expected to run wine to the rest of the tables in the restaurant </span>, and my <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze8"> tips </span> suffered because of it.... The company we sent our laundry to refused to do it anymore after I was there for <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze9"> a month </span>.... Eventually I <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze10"> had enough </span>, <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze11"> found a new job </span> and <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze12"> left </span>. At that point, only twoÂ servers worked there besides me because turnover was so high.... Servers were without their last two paychecks, any credit card tips from the last month, and without a job.Â I ’m <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze13"> just glad I <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze14"> got out while I <span class="cloze document017 chain4 cloze15"> did </span> </span> </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document017 chain5"><p>... He was our <span class="cloze document017 chain5 cloze0"> dishwasher </span>.... The company we <span class="cloze document017 chain5 cloze1"> sent our <span class="cloze document017 chain5 cloze2"> laundry </span> to </span> refused to do it anymore after I was there for a month.... We <span class="cloze document017 chain5 cloze3"> ran out of ice every night </span> and management was too cheap to buy ice, so our <span class="cloze document017 chain5 cloze4"> customers </span> went without. On top of all that, our <span class="cloze document017 chain5 cloze5"> paychecks </span> almost never went through.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document017 chain6"><p>... The company we <span class="cloze document017 chain6 cloze0"> sent our laundry to </span> refused to <span class="cloze document017 chain6 cloze1"> do it anymore after I was there for a month </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document017 chain7"><p>... But most nights, I would be the only server old enough to serve alcohol, so on top of all my tables, I was also expected to run wine to the rest of the tables in the restaurant, and my tips <span class="cloze document017 chain7 cloze0"> suffered because of it </span>. They were also <span class="cloze document017 chain7 cloze1"> incredibly cheap </span>.... They hadn't been <span class="cloze document017 chain7 cloze2"> paid in weeks </span>. The ice machine broke so they <span class="cloze document017 chain7 cloze3"> bought plastic ice trays </span> and <span class="cloze document017 chain7 cloze4"> put them in the freezer </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document018 chain0"><p>... I then <span class="cloze document018 chain0 cloze0"> see my manager at the table </span>.... So my manager <span class="cloze document018 chain0 cloze1"> gave them a $ 15 discount on their $ 85 bill </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document018 chain1"><p>... Well I noticed their food was almost <span class="cloze document018 chain1 cloze0"> gone the last time </span> I checked on them.... They told her the food was <span class="cloze document018 chain1 cloze1"> horrible </span>, the ribs had no meat, and everything was just terrible.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document018 chain2"><p> I work for a corporate chain so customers are not always of <span class="cloze document018 chain2 cloze0"> the best quality </span>, but I try not to prejudge my tables because they <span class="cloze document018 chain2 cloze1"> seem to surprise me now and then </span>. So I had a four top and yes, they did <span class="cloze document018 chain2 cloze2"> look like white trash </span>. But I gave them great service, always refilling drinks, clearing plates, checking on them.... Well I noticed their <span class="cloze document018 chain2 cloze3"> food </span> was almost gone the last time I checked on them.... They <span class="cloze document018 chain2 cloze4"> told her the food was horrible </span>, the ribs <span class="cloze document018 chain2 cloze5"> had no meat </span>, and everything was just terrible. They never once <span class="cloze document018 chain2 cloze6"> complained to me </span>. So my manager gave them a $ 15 discount on their <span class="cloze document018 chain2 cloze7"> $ 85 bill </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document018 chain3"><p>... I honestly think they just didn't <span class="cloze document018 chain3 cloze0"> realize how much they <span class="cloze document018 chain3 cloze1"> spent </span> and were <span class="cloze document018 chain3 cloze2"> mad </span> about it </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document018 chain4"><p>... I <span class="cloze document018 chain4 cloze0"> gave her change </span> and was fiddlingÂ in my pockets for her coin change which was 40 cents ; she said just <span class="cloze document018 chain4 cloze1"> keep it </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document018 chain5"><p>... They <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze0"> told her the food was horrible </span>, the ribs had no meat, and everything was just terrible.... The lady was <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze1"> still mad her <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze2"> bill </span> was high </span>. She <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze3"> gave me a $ 50 bill </span> and <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze4"> said she <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze5"> had to go out and get more money from her <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze6"> husband </span> </span> </span>. She <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze7"> came back </span> and <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze8"> gave me a $ 20 bill </span>. I gave her <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze9"> change </span> and was fiddlingÂ in my pockets for her <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze10"> coin change </span> which was 40 cents ; she <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze11"> said just keep it </span>.... During all the complaining she was <span class="cloze document018 chain5 cloze12"> saying how great </span> I am and it wasn't my fault.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document018 chain6"><p> I <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze0"> work for a corporate chain so customers are not always of the best quality </span>, but I <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze1"> try not to prejudge my <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze2"> tables </span> because they seem to <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze3"> surprise me now and then </span> </span>.

Well I <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze6"> noticed their food was almost gone the last time </span> I <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze7"> checked on them </span>. I was <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze8"> taking care of other tables </span> and <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze9"> running food and bar drinks </span>. I then <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze10"> see my <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze11"> manager </span> at the table </span>.... They never once complained to me. So my <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze12"> manager </span> gave them a $ 15 discount on their $ 85 bill....

During all the complaining she was saying how great I <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze16"> am </span> and it wasn't my <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze17"> fault </span>. Well where was my <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze18"> tip </span>? I honestly <span class="cloze document018 chain6 cloze19"> think they just didn't realize how much they spent and were mad about it </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain0"><p>... I ’ve also had problems where a person in my party asks for the bill for everyone else <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze0"> and other people didn't <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze1"> know </span> and they had gotten mad at me for </span> giving them the bill that their <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze2"> friend </span> asked for. So now I am extra careful about not giving the bill to customers unless I can find a hint that they are <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze3"> ready for the bill </span> or straight up <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze4"> tell me they are <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze5"> ready for it </span> </span>. These couples <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze6"> did neither </span> ; they were <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze7"> deep </span> in conversation and <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze8"> told me they were <span class="cloze document020 chain0 cloze9"> fine for the moment </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain1"><p>... Then he tells me about how long they <span class="cloze document020 chain1 cloze0"> waited to get their <span class="cloze document020 chain1 cloze1"> bill </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain2"><p>... Unless you <span class="cloze document020 chain2 cloze0"> tell me you are <span class="cloze document020 chain2 cloze1"> ready for the bill </span> or <span class="cloze document020 chain2 cloze2"> signal me in some obvious way </span> </span>, I am not going to just drop a check on the table.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain3"><p>... Finally, one of the guys nods his head to me signaling that they were <span class="cloze document020 chain3 cloze0"> ready </span> for the bill, so I head right over to the computer and start getting their <span class="cloze document020 chain3 cloze1"> bill </span> ready.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain4"><p>... Despite it just being <span class="cloze document020 chain4 cloze0"> a serving job </span>, I take my job seriously as it <span class="cloze document020 chain4 cloze1"> pays my bills </span> and I genuinely do care about the service and quality of food that my patrons receive.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain5"><p>... However I have met problems in the past where customers <span class="cloze document020 chain5 cloze0"> didn't like it when I asked if they were <span class="cloze document020 chain5 cloze1"> ready for the bill when they were still <span class="cloze document020 chain5 cloze2"> deep </span> in conversation (as these 4 seemed to be) </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain6"><p>... I did not want to <span class="cloze document020 chain6 cloze0"> rush or push the bill on them </span>, so I go over multiple times to ask if everyone was still doing good, looking for a hint that they were ready for the bill.... However I have met problems in the past where customers didn't like it when I asked if they were ready for the bill when they were still deep in conversation (as these 4 seemed to be). I ’ve also had problems where a person in my party asks for the bill for everyone else and other people didn't know and they had gotten mad at me for <span class="cloze document020 chain6 cloze1"> giving them the bill that their friend asked for </span>.

Unless you tell me you are ready for the bill or signal me in some obvious way, I am not going to just drop a check on the table. And obviously, as I stated above, everyone seems to have different expectations about being <span class="cloze document020 chain6 cloze5"> given the bill </span>, so I have learned to just take the most straightforward tactic.... She takes some discounts off of the bill and then walks over and apologizes for the bad service they got.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain7"><p>... I ’ve also had problems where a person in my party asks for the bill for everyone else and other people didn't know and they had gotten mad at me for giving them the bill that their friend <span class="cloze document020 chain7 cloze0"> asked for </span>.... And don't get me wrong, I only tell you this because my wife and my friend's <span class="cloze document020 chain7 cloze1"> wife </span> were both servers, so they know exactly how a table should be served.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain8"><p> I am <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze0"> a server </span> at a busy pub.... However near the end of the night, the hour before I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze1"> got off </span>, the pub slowed down and I was <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze2"> sort of on autopilot and not really paying attention </span> to details, which is actually quite rare for me.... I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze3"> went through the motions of serving them, checking up, refilling, etc </span>. They were all smiles and <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze4"> telling me </span> everything was wonderful every time I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze5"> checked up on them </span>, so I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze6"> thought everything was fine </span>.... As they were finishing their food I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze7"> started to take their plates away (they were sharing appies) </span>. However in-between clearing their dishes, I would also <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze8"> stop at my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze9"> other tables </span> to check up on them before going back to see if they had more dishes to clear </span>. Now one of my other tables had friends who were sitting in another section, and they <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze10"> asked me if they could move over there and I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze11"> said sure </span> </span>. As they started their migration, I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze12"> started cleaning up the now empty dirty table </span>. Apparently my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze13"> party </span> of 4 did not like that. They didn't appreciate the fact that I had <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze14"> cleared that table first before stopping over to take away more of the finished appy plates </span>. However every time I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze15"> checked back with them everything was fine </span> and they were very happy with everything. So in that moment I hadn't <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze16"> realized yet that there was a problem </span>.... I did not <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze17"> want to rush or push the bill on them </span>, so I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze18"> go over multiple times to ask if everyone was still doing good, looking for a hint that they were ready for the bill </span>. Every time they would tell me everything was fine. Now, perhaps I should have <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze19"> taken that as a sign to ask if they were ready for the check </span>. However I have <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze20"> met problems in the past where customers didn't like it when I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze21"> asked if they were ready for the bill when they were still deep in conversation (as these 4 seemed to be) </span> </span>. I ’ve also <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze22"> had problems where a person in my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze23"> party </span> asks for the bill for everyone else and other people didn't know </span> and they had gotten mad at me for giving them the bill that their friend asked for. So now I am <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze24"> extra careful </span> about not giving the bill to customers unless I can <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze25"> find a hint that they are ready for the bill or straight up <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze26"> tell me they are ready for it </span> </span>. These couples did neither ; they were deep in conversation and <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze27"> told me they were fine for the moment </span>.... Finally, one of the guys nods his head to me signaling that they were ready </span> for the bill, so I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze28"> head right over to the computer </span> and <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze29"> start getting their bill ready </span>. As I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze30"> do so the guy comes up to me and asks, "Just a question </span>, how long have you worked here?" I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze31"> said, "For a while, sir </span>." Then he <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze32"> continues to <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze33"> tell me, "Okay, let me <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze34"> give you a little advice about serving etiquette </span> </span> </span>. And don't get me <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze35"> wrong </span>, I only <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze36"> tell you this because my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze37"> wife </span> and my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze38"> friend's </span> wife were both servers </span>, so they know exactly how a table should be served. So I am just <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze39"> giving you some advice so that you will know too </span> …" First he talks about me <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze40"> clearing the other table first before going back around and clearing off the appy </span> plates they finished. OK fair enough, on any usual day I would <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze41"> know better too </span> ; he got me <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze42"> there </span>. Then he <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze43"> tells me about how long they waited to get their bill </span>. I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze44"> felt like that was unwarranted </span>. I can't <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze45"> read minds </span>. Unless you <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze46"> tell me you are ready for the bill or <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze47"> signal me in some obvious way </span> </span>, I am not <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze48"> going to just drop a check on the table </span>. And obviously, as I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze49"> stated above </span>, everyone seems to have different expectations about being given the bill, so I have <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze50"> learned to just take the most straightforward tactic </span>. Communication is key though because I am not <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze51"> a psychic </span>.... He continued to give me a 10 minute lecture about how he's an amazing tipper and therefore he deserves better service, how he wasn't one of those "@ $ $ holes" (his words) who would tip me <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze52"> nothing </span>, but that I should have <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze53"> taken the (his words again) "F@#ken plates out of his face" as soon as he was done </span>, and that he was telling me all of this because he has daughters who work so he doesn't want to not tip, but believes he had deserved better service. I was <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze54"> flabbergasted </span>. I didn't <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze55"> know what to say </span> ; all I could <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze56"> do </span> was apologize. But this guy then said that he did not want my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze57"> apology </span>, but just wanted me </span> to know so that the next time he comes in again he hopefully sees some improvement in me.... My <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze58"> manager </span> hears all of this and <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze59"> tells me when the guy walks away that she will take care of it </span>.... When they left, they had given me a big tip. Despite getting a good tip, this experience has left me <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze60"> somewhat embarrassed and upset </span> </span>. I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze61"> felt like the clearing of the plate issue was, true, my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze62"> fault </span> </span>, but did not <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze63"> warrant a 10-minute verbal lashing </span>.... I will be <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze64"> the first </span> to admit that I was <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze65"> distracted </span> and not on my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze66"> A-game </span>. What he said had valid points, and usually I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze67"> should </span> and do <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze68"> know better </span>. Despite it just being a serving job, I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze69"> take my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze70"> job </span> seriously as it pays my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze71"> bills </span> and I genuinely <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze72"> do care about the service and quality of food that my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze73"> patrons </span> receive </span> </span>. So to be given such a stern talking to, with the man standing up and swearing at me about the things I <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze74"> did wrong </span>, kind of made me <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze75"> feel like I was such <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze76"> a horrible person </span> who was horrible at my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze77"> job </span> </span> and clearly never knew how bad I was at <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze78"> my <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze79"> job </span> </span>.... I don't <span class="cloze document020 chain8 cloze80"> know </span>, what are other people's thoughts on this? </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain9"><p>... As I do so the guy <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze0"> comes up to me </span> and <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze1"> asks, "Just a question </span>, how long have you worked here?"... So I am just giving you some advice so that you will know too …" First he <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze2"> talks about me clearing the other table first before going back around and clearing off the appy </span> plates they finished.

But this guy then said that he did not <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze15"> want my apology </span>, but just wanted me </span> </span> to know so that the next time he <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze16"> comes in again he hopefully <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze17"> sees some improvement in me </span> </span>. Then he <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze18"> goes </span> and <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze19"> sits back down </span>. My manager <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze20"> hears all of this </span> and <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze21"> tells me when the guy <span class="cloze document020 chain9 cloze22"> walks away that she will take care of it </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain10"><p>... My manager hears all of this and tells me when the guy walks away that she will <span class="cloze document020 chain10 cloze0"> take care of it </span>. She <span class="cloze document020 chain10 cloze1"> takes some discounts off of the bill </span> and then <span class="cloze document020 chain10 cloze2"> walks over </span> and apologizes for the bad service they got.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain11"><p>... So a party of 4 <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze0"> walks in ; they are <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze1"> a pair </span> of older couples and were actually <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze2"> very nice </span> </span>. They were <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze3"> very easy </span> about their <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze4"> drink order </span> and <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze5"> prompt with ordering food too </span>. I went through the motions of <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze6"> serving them </span>, checking up, refilling, etc. They were <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze7"> all smiles </span> and telling me everything was wonderful every time I checked up on them, so I thought everything was fine.... As they were <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze8"> finishing their <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze9"> food </span> </span> I started to take their <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze10"> plates </span> away (they were <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze11"> sharing appies </span>). However in-between clearing their <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze12"> dishes </span>, I would also stop at my other tables to check up on them before going back to see if they <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze13"> had more dishes to clear </span>. Now one of my other tables had friends who were sitting in another section, and they <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze14"> asked me if they could <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze15"> move over there </span> and I said sure </span>. As they <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze16"> started their <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze17"> migration </span> </span>, I started cleaning up the now empty dirty table. Apparently my party of 4 <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze18"> did not like that </span>. They didn't <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze19"> appreciate the fact that I had cleared that table first before stopping over to take away more of the finished appy plates </span>. However every time I checked back with them everything was fine and they were <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze20"> very happy </span> with everything.... So they <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze21"> finished all of their food (and everything was cleared except their <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze22"> drinks </span>) </span>, but were <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze23"> sitting and talking for a while </span>. I did not want to rush or push the bill on them, so I go over multiple times to ask if everyone was still doing good, looking for a hint that they were <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze24"> ready for the bill </span>. Every time they would <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze25"> tell me everything </span> was fine. Now, perhaps I should have taken that as a sign to ask if they were <span class="cloze document020 chain11 cloze26"> ready for the check </span>.... I ’ve also had problems where a person in my party asks for the bill for everyone else and other people didn't know and they had gotten mad at me for giving them the bill that their friend asked for.... The other 3 people in the party looked really confused at first, and then the wives became very embarrassed and started saying that there was no problem and that everything was great.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain12"><p>... Then he continues to tell me, "Okay, let me give you a little advice about serving etiquette. And don't get me wrong, I only tell you <span class="cloze document020 chain12 cloze0"> this </span> because my wife and my friend's wife were both servers, so they know exactly how a table should be served. So I am just giving you some advice so that you will <span class="cloze document020 chain12 cloze1"> know too </span> …" First he talks about me clearing the other table first before going back around and clearing off the appy plates they finished.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document020 chain13"><p>... She takes some discounts off of the bill and then walks over and apologizes for the bad service they <span class="cloze document020 chain13 cloze0"> got </span>. The other 3 people in the party <span class="cloze document020 chain13 cloze1"> looked really confused at first </span>, and then the wives <span class="cloze document020 chain13 cloze2"> became very embarrassed </span> and <span class="cloze document020 chain13 cloze3"> started saying that there was no problem and that everything was great </span>. When they <span class="cloze document020 chain13 cloze4"> left </span>, they had <span class="cloze document020 chain13 cloze5"> given me a big tip </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document021 chain0"><p>... This table's appetizer <span class="cloze document021 chain0 cloze0"> came out </span> and I <span class="cloze document021 chain0 cloze1"> set it down on the table </span> and walked away. I came back a few minutes later to check on them, and the woman (it was <span class="cloze document021 chain0 cloze2"> a married couple </span>) at the table said there was no cutlery so I apologized and went to <span class="cloze document021 chain0 cloze3"> grab it </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document021 chain1"><p>... I came back a few minutes later to check on them, and the woman (it was a married couple) at the table <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze0"> said there was no cutlery so I apologized and went to grab it </span>.... I dropped the cutlery off and <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze1"> asked the woman if she would <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze2"> like more water </span> </span> and she <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze3"> declined </span>.... The man's wife was <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze4"> trying to calm him down </span>, but he <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze5"> told her that they were leaving and that she was not <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze6"> allowed to eat any of her <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze7"> food </span> </span> </span>.... I <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze8"> asked the woman if I could box up her <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze9"> food </span> and she <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze10"> said yes </span> </span>, but the man would not let her <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze11"> take any of it </span>.... I ’ve never experienced someone this rude before, and I personally feel bad for his wife who genuinely wanted to eat her <span class="cloze document021 chain1 cloze12"> food </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document021 chain2"><p> I <span class="cloze document021 chain2 cloze0"> had a table tonight that told me my service was horrible </span>.... This table's <span class="cloze document021 chain2 cloze1"> appetizer </span> came out and I set it down on the table and walked away. I came back a few minutes later to check on them, and the woman (it was a married couple) at the table said there was no cutlery so I apologized and went to grab it.... Later I went out to the table again to see if I could grab their appetizer plate, because I was taking a few other empty plates to the back already.... Then I ran this table's <span class="cloze document021 chain2 cloze2"> entrees </span> out.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document021 chain3"><p> I had a table tonight that told me my service was <span class="cloze document021 chain3 cloze0"> horrible </span>.... He then told me my service was <span class="cloze document021 chain3 cloze1"> horrible </span>, and I apologized again and they left.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document021 chain4"><p>... I did not notice that the man's drink was <span class="cloze document021 chain4 cloze0"> empty </span>, which I admit was my fault.... While I should have noticed his drink was <span class="cloze document021 chain4 cloze1"> empty </span> (that was my fault), I also believe he could have spoken up when I didn't notice and asked for another one.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document021 chain5"><p> I <span class="cloze document021 chain5 cloze0"> had a table tonight that <span class="cloze document021 chain5 cloze1"> told me my <span class="cloze document021 chain5 cloze2"> service </span> was horrible </span> </span>. Now I won't <span class="cloze document021 chain5 cloze3"> try to say that I <span class="cloze document021 chain5 cloze4"> did nothing wrong, because I could have been more on top of <span class="cloze document021 chain5 cloze5"> things </span> </span> </span>, but I still <span class="cloze document021 chain5 cloze6"> feel as though they overreacted </span>. This table's appetizer came out and I <span class="cloze document021 chain5 cloze7"> set it down on the table </span> and <span class="cloze document021 chain5 cloze8"> walked away </span>.

<div class="chain document022 chain0"><p>...

<div class="chain document027 chain3"><p>... The Oriental couple will not listen to anything she or any of her employees <span class="cloze document027 chain3 cloze0"> say </span> </span>.

<div class="chain document027 chain5"><p>... We have also had paychecks bounce because they don't <span class="cloze document027 chain5 cloze0"> have enough funds in their <span class="cloze document027 chain5 cloze1"> account </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document027 chain6"><p>... We have waitresses crying because they got yelled at for asking for clean cups when there <span class="cloze document027 chain6 cloze0">'s a rush </span>.

<div class="chain document027 chain7"><p>...

Another thing, we can not <span class="cloze document027 chain12 cloze5"> accept credit card tips </span>. We can <span class="cloze document027 chain12 cloze6"> accept credit cards </span> but there's no tip spot on the card ; the owners say it costs too much to replace the machine.

Their <span class="cloze document027 chain14 cloze2"> restaurants </span> are just disgusting. They would get <span class="cloze document027 chain14 cloze3"> shut down by the Health Department for dirty things ; plates, cups, silverware </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document028 chain0"><p>... The place isn't <span class="cloze document028 chain0 cloze0"> too busy </span>, and we ’re seated as soon as we walk in, which is nice. So it <span class="cloze document028 chain0 cloze1"> comes time to order </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document028 chain1"><p>... "Yes, you can have <span class="cloze document028 chain1 cloze0"> poached eggs </span>.

<div class="chain document028 chain2"><p>...

I ask the girl if the eggs can be <span class="cloze document028 chain2 cloze2"> prepared poached </span>.... Yolk is slowly dripping out of the four little puncture holes of my eggs.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document028 chain3"><p>...

<div class="chain document028 chain4"><p> My boyfriend and I recently <span class="cloze document028 chain4 cloze0"> went to a little diner that was near our <span class="cloze document028 chain4 cloze1"> house </span> </span> </span>. The place isn't too busy, and we ’re <span class="cloze document028 chain4 cloze2"> seated as soon as we <span class="cloze document028 chain4 cloze3"> walk in, which is nice </span> </span>.... Our <span class="cloze document028 chain4 cloze4"> waitress </span> was fairly young, probably in college, but so far she seemed really nice and had been back to our <span class="cloze document028 chain4 cloze5"> table </span> already to refill our <span class="cloze document028 chain4 cloze6"> coffees </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document028 chain5"><p> My <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze0"> boyfriend </span> and I recently <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze1"> went to a little diner that was near our house </span>....

I <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze8"> ask the girl if the eggs can be prepared poached </span>. She gives me the blankest stare, not saying a word.... So I <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze9"> tell her that I ’d <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze10"> like over easy eggs </span> </span>.... You just <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze11"> asked if we served ‘ poached ’ eggs </span> !"... "Um, I just assumed you didn't <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze12"> serve poached eggs so </span> <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze13"> -" She interrupts me </span>, <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze14"> shushing me </span>.

And even if they weren't, why did the waitress have to know exactly what I <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze20"> meant when I <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze21"> ordered something </span> </span>?... "I ’ll <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze22"> go see if the chef makes ‘ poached ’ eggs </span>.... Did she think I was <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze23"> trying to trick her </span>? Did she think poached eggs weren't a real thing and I was just <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze24"> wanting to give her a hard time </span>? Did she think I <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze25"> wanted poached eggs as in eggs that had been illegally hunted </span>?... "Yes, you can have <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze26"> poached eggs </span>. Do you still <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze27"> want them </span>?"... I should probably have <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze28"> just said no, since the topic of poached eggs was a rough topic for this girl </span>. But I <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze29"> ordered them anyway </span>. The girl was probably just stressed from college or work, and I wasn't <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze30"> going to treat her poorly over poached eggs </span>.... Yolk is slowly dripping out of the four little puncture holes of my <span class="cloze document028 chain5 cloze31"> eggs </span>.

<div class="chain document028 chain6"><p>... Our waitress was <span class="cloze document028 chain6 cloze0"> fairly young </span>, probably in college, but so far she <span class="cloze document028 chain6 cloze1"> seemed really nice </span> and had <span class="cloze document028 chain6 cloze2"> been back to our table already </span> to refill our coffees....

And even if they weren't, why did the waitress <span class="cloze document028 chain6 cloze12"> have to know exactly what I meant when I ordered something </span>?...

<div class="chain document028 chain7"><p>...

"They ’re just <span class="cloze document028 chain7 cloze3"> eggs </span> that -" Shushed again.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document029 chain0"><p>... The server, who had been very pleasant to us (he was kind enough to <span class="cloze document029 chain0 cloze0"> give us directions </span> and told us to be careful walking around at night !), was rather rude to them.... He ranted about them just coming in </span> for drinks and the diner not being good enough for them to <span class="cloze document029 chain0 cloze1"> eat in </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document029 chain1"><p>... But the servers were <span class="cloze document029 chain1 cloze0"> nothing to write home about </span>. They would <span class="cloze document029 chain1 cloze1"> give us our food </span> and <span class="cloze document029 chain1 cloze2"> walk off </span>. In England the waitresses etc. are nice enough, but I guess we assumed that in the States they would be <span class="cloze document029 chain1 cloze3"> more attentive </span> given the fact that tips are a big part of the dining experience.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document029 chain2"><p>... But we only ever managed to get the server's <span class="cloze document029 chain2 cloze0"> attention </span> when it was <span class="cloze document029 chain2 cloze1"> more </span> or <span class="cloze document029 chain2 cloze2"> less </span> time to pay the bill.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document029 chain3"><p>... A family of 4 <span class="cloze document029 chain3 cloze0"> came in </span> and <span class="cloze document029 chain3 cloze1"> sat at the booth behind us </span> ; they only <span class="cloze document029 chain3 cloze2"> ordered drinks </span>.... I ’m not sure if the family was <span class="cloze document029 chain3 cloze3"> visiting like we were or were natives </span>.... The family wasn't <span class="cloze document029 chain3 cloze4"> doing anything </span> and isn't that the whole point of a diner?... </p></div>

<div class="chain document029 chain4"><p>... So my sister and I were <span class="cloze document029 chain4 cloze0"> visiting New York City (our first time in the States) </span>.... My sister wasn't <span class="cloze document029 chain4 cloze1"> hungry </span> so she only <span class="cloze document029 chain4 cloze2"> ordered coffee </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document029 chain5"><p> I ’m one of those English people who doesn't particularly understand "tipping" just because we don't <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze0"> do it here (or very seldom !) </span>... So my sister and I were visiting New York City (our <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze1"> first time </span> in the States). We <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze2"> dined out nearly every evening while we were <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze3"> there </span> over the Christmas period </span>. The first few different restaurants we <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze4"> went into </span> were fine enough.... They would give us our <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze5"> food </span> and walk off. In England the waitresses etc. are nice enough, but I guess we <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze6"> assumed that in the States they would be more attentive given the fact that tips are a big part of the dining experience </span>.... We always <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze7"> tipped around $ 28.00 ($ 14.00 each) </span>. We ’re <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze8"> students </span> so we were on <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze9"> a budget </span> ! One time when we were <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze10"> visiting Brooklyn we <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze11"> went into one of these diners that <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze12"> reminded us of the ones </span> </span> </span> we ’ve <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze13"> seen in the movies </span>. It was dead in there ; we were <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze14"> the only ones </span>.... A family of 4 came in and sat at the booth behind us ; they only ordered drinks. The server, who had been very pleasant to us (he was kind enough to give us directions and <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze15"> told us to be careful walking around at night </span> !)... I ’m not sure if the family was visiting like we <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze16"> were </span> or were natives.... We <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze17"> tipped him </span> and <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze18"> went on our <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze19"> way </span> </span>.... I know we don't <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze20"> have the best reputation for tipping </span>, but can't we be <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze21"> forgiven as it's not part of our <span class="cloze document029 chain5 cloze22"> culture/society type </span> of thing </span>? </p></div>

<div class="chain document029 chain6"><p> I ’m <span class="cloze document029 chain6 cloze0"> one </span> of those English people who doesn't particularly understand "tipping" just because we don't do it here (or very seldom !)...

I <span class="cloze document029 chain6 cloze4"> understand Christmas time is a busy time, but I was <span class="cloze document029 chain6 cloze5"> expecting at least the usual "Is everything OK?" </span> </span>... My <span class="cloze document029 chain6 cloze6"> sister </span> wasn't hungry so she only ordered coffee. I <span class="cloze document029 chain6 cloze7"> had a drink and something to eat </span>....

I was taken aback ; I wasn't sure what had changed his <span class="cloze document029 chain7 cloze1"> mood </span> !... We <span class="cloze document029 chain7 cloze2"> tipped him </span> and went on our way.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document030 chain0"><p>... The young couple are <span class="cloze document030 chain0 cloze0"> newlyweds </span> as evidenced by the fact they gave his <span class="cloze document030 chain0 cloze1"> parents </span> a CD with wedding pics as well a card to tell them they were pregnant.... The young couple had <span class="cloze document030 chain0 cloze2"> been here before </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document030 chain1"><p>... The food was good, and the service was great, but the four people sitting in the booth across from us were <span class="cloze document030 chain1 cloze0"> another story </span> !... Their <span class="cloze document030 chain1 cloze1"> server </span> was a blond woman and ours was an older man. Not ONE employee did anything about their <span class="cloze document030 chain1 cloze2"> obnoxious behavior </span> ! All four people – older man, older woman, their <span class="cloze document030 chain1 cloze3"> son </span> and daughter-in-law – talked LOUDLY the entire time. We could hear every word they <span class="cloze document030 chain1 cloze4"> said </span>, so I ’m outing the fact that they are <span class="cloze document030 chain1 cloze5"> expecting a BABY in July </span> but do not want it known until January.... They <span class="cloze document030 chain1 cloze6"> took three pregnancy tests </span> !

The young couple are newlyweds as evidenced by the fact they <span class="cloze document030 chain1 cloze8"> gave his parents a CD with wedding pics as well a card to <span class="cloze document030 chain1 cloze9"> tell them they </span> </span> were pregnant.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document030 chain3"><p>... Also, older man ordered pizza, older woman didn't like tons of garlic, young woman got a salad, other three got pasta, and they <span class="cloze document030 chain3 cloze0"> got a lemon cake to go </span>.... They <span class="cloze document030 chain3 cloze1"> got up first </span>, but they were <span class="cloze document030 chain3 cloze2"> standing around at the front talking, so they <span class="cloze document030 chain3 cloze3"> left at the same time we did and continued acting rowdy in the parking lot </span> </span>.

<div class="chain document030 chain6"><p> My <span class="cloze document030 chain6 cloze0"> family </span> had an experience at an Atlanta pizzeria the other night that you ’re going to find unbelievable....

Also, they saw me glance over at them fairly early, but they still continued to act obnoxious, totally oblivious to the fact that we could hear them !... </p></div>

<div class="chain document030 chain7"><p>... All four people – older man, older woman, their son and daughter-in-law – talked LOUDLY the entire time.... DIL was 32, blond, wore a skirt, brown knee-high boots and black tights, and wore her <span class="cloze document030 chain7 cloze0"> hair </span> up.... Older woman was <span class="cloze document030 chain7 cloze1"> bleach blond </span> with bags under her <span class="cloze document030 chain7 cloze2"> eyes </span>. More details – young couple have a dog, there is already one grandchild, young woman got mom a necklace as a gift, talked about her <span class="cloze document030 chain7 cloze3"> wedding ring </span>, couple went to Funky Monkey place.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document032 chain2"><p> A while back, two buddies and I <span class="cloze document032 chain2 cloze0"> went to a well-known chain restaurant to celebrate a birthday </span>....

<div class="chain document032 chain3"><p>... However, his lip and gum <span class="cloze document032 chain3 cloze0"> had some inflammation from where the plastic had scratched it </span> </span>. After a few minutes, the manager came back and said, "We <span class="cloze document032 chain3 cloze1"> found the problem </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document032 chain4"><p>... All we asked was that the restaurant carefully <span class="cloze document032 chain4 cloze0"> prepare its <span class="cloze document032 chain4 cloze1"> meals </span> so thatÂ no one else finds a plastic present in their food </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document032 chain5"><p>... Then, out of nowhere, my buddy (birthday boy) lets out a vociferous shriek....

Out came his <span class="cloze document032 chain5 cloze2"> pasta special </span>, along with shards of clear plastic ! Immediately we flag down our server and demand that the manager <span class="cloze document032 chain5 cloze3"> come to our table </span>.... The manager and server stood there while the birthday boy <span class="cloze document032 chain5 cloze4"> picks out the shards with his <span class="cloze document032 chain5 cloze5"> fork </span> </span>. Fortunately he wasn't <span class="cloze document032 chain5 cloze6"> bleeding </span>.

<div class="chain document032 chain8"><p>... The place was packed ; however, we were <span class="cloze document032 chain8 cloze0"> seated in no time </span>. Our <span class="cloze document032 chain8 cloze1"> meals </span> looked absolutely scrumptious when they arrived at the table. So we ’re <span class="cloze document032 chain8 cloze2"> eating, having a good time </span>, laughing, talking about inside jokes, etc.... My other buddy and I fell back in our <span class="cloze document032 chain8 cloze3"> chairs </span> in complete shock. Before we could even <span class="cloze document032 chain8 cloze4"> ask what was wrong </span>, the birthday boy upchucks whatever was in his mouth....

He was offered a new meal, but my friend just wanted it comped so we could <span class="cloze document032 chain8 cloze7"> leave </span>.

<div class="chain document033 chain0"><p>... I ’ve already paid my bill and finished eating, but I end up chatting with my regular waitress and sipping coffee. At 9:30 on the dot a woman <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze0"> comes into the restaurant </span>.

As soon as she <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze5"> sits down </span>, she <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze6"> gets on her <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze7"> cell phone </span> </span>.

The woman <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze12"> tries to open her <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze13"> teabag </span> with her <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze14"> teeth </span> and one hand while holding the phone with her <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze15"> other </span> </span>. Of course, she <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze16"> breaks the teabag inside </span>. At this point, she finally <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze17"> decides to get off the phone </span> and <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze18"> gets huffy with the waitress about the "defective teabag" and how she <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze19"> needs to place her <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze20"> order </span> "right now because she's in <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze21"> a hurry </span> </span> </span>."... The waitress dutifully <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze22"> replaces the teabag </span> and <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze23"> takes her <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze24"> order </span> </span>.... Yes, she <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze25"> wasted thirty minutes of the waitress ’ and chef's time to order $ 2.50 worth of items off the menu </span>. At that point I left, so I don't know how long the woman <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze26"> stayed at the restaurant </span>, but I brought it up to my waitress the next time I went to eat there. My waitress <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze27"> rolled her <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze28"> eyes </span> </span>. "She <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze29"> does the same thing every week </span>. And not once has she ever <span class="cloze document033 chain0 cloze30"> tipped </span>." </p></div>

<div class="chain document033 chain1"><p>... As soon as she sits down, she gets on her cell phone. The waitress makes several attempts to take her order, but the woman continues to talk and laugh loudly on her phone for fifteen minutes (keep in mind this is a small restaurant with a quiet atmosphere), only bothering to say "hot tea" in between phone calls.... The woman tries to open her teabag with her teeth and one hand while <span class="cloze document033 chain1 cloze0"> holding the phone with her other </span>....

<div class="chain document033 chain4"><p> I <span class="cloze document033 chain4 cloze0"> had a day off </span> and <span class="cloze document033 chain4 cloze1"> went to breakfast at one of my favorite local places </span>, a restaurant attached to a B&B that only served breakfast and dinner.

At this point I ’m just <span class="cloze document033 chain4 cloze9"> sticking around to watch the show </span>.... At that point I <span class="cloze document033 chain4 cloze10"> left </span>, so I don't <span class="cloze document033 chain4 cloze11"> know how long the woman stayed at the restaurant </span>, but I <span class="cloze document033 chain4 cloze12"> brought it up to my <span class="cloze document033 chain4 cloze13"> waitress </span> the next time I <span class="cloze document033 chain4 cloze14"> went to eat there </span> </span>. My <span class="cloze document033 chain4 cloze15"> waitress </span> rolled her eyes.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document033 chain5"><p> I had a day off and went to breakfast at one of my favorite local places, a restaurant <span class="cloze document033 chain5 cloze0"> attached to a B&B that only served breakfast and dinner </span>....

At that point I left, so I don't know how long the woman stayed at the restaurant, but I <span class="cloze document033 chain5 cloze1"> brought it up to my waitress the next time I went to eat there </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain0"><p>... Not even after a minute (literally) of getting our menus, the waitress <span class="cloze document034 chain0 cloze0"> asked if we wanted drinks and if we were ready to order the entrées </span>.... We went ahead and gave our entrée orders anyway while she was at <span class="cloze document034 chain0 cloze1"> the table </span>. After a few minutes a different waitress <span class="cloze document034 chain0 cloze2"> delivers our appetizer </span>. Instead of politely moving the items on our table to the side to make room for the appetizer, she <span class="cloze document034 chain0 cloze3"> pushes them around with the plate before setting it down, nearly knocking over our drinks, then walks away without a word even after we politely said, "That was quick </span> !... I gave the waitress the gift card and <span class="cloze document034 chain0 cloze4"> asked her to run it through to make sure that it worked (I didn't want to stiff them in case it was declined) </span>. Sure enough, she <span class="cloze document034 chain0 cloze5"> comes back saying it is declined and that the system may be down and that we needed to wait a while for the system to reboot </span>. After 15 minutes she <span class="cloze document034 chain0 cloze6"> tries again </span>.... Finally, after another 10 minutes, she <span class="cloze document034 chain0 cloze7"> comes back saying the card was declined again and to call the number </span>.... She <span class="cloze document034 chain0 cloze8"> kept insisting it wouldn't work and that they did not know what to do </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain1"><p>... After a few minutes a different waitress <span class="cloze document034 chain1 cloze0"> delivers our appetizer </span>. Instead of politely moving the items on our table to the side to make room for the appetizer, she pushes them around with the plate before setting it down, nearly knocking over our drinks, then walks away without a word even after we politely said, "That was quick !... Then, a runner swoops in with the entrées just seconds after our appetizer was <span class="cloze document034 chain1 cloze1"> delivered </span>. No big concern ; however, the whole point of our appetizer was to munch for a bit of time before the entrées arrived.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain2"><p>... The rep told us that the restaurant <span class="cloze document034 chain2 cloze0"> has a hotline to call to manually punch in the card number in case </span> it doesn't <span class="cloze document034 chain2 cloze1"> swipe </span> into the system. It <span class="cloze document034 chain2 cloze2"> looks like the restaurant didn't even <span class="cloze document034 chain2 cloze3"> bother calling </span> </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain3"><p>... As soon as we walked in we noticed the place was slow and quiet ; only two or three other parties were <span class="cloze document034 chain3 cloze0"> dining </span> – not bad. We were cordially seated at the booth RIGHT next to the main entrance, even though all the other parties were <span class="cloze document034 chain3 cloze1"> seated in the back near the kitchen </span>.... I figured we ’d be closer to the kitchen or grouped somewhat close to the other parties.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain4"><p> My wife and I <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze0"> decided to go out for lunch last weekend </span> </span>.

As soon as we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze2"> walked in we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze3"> noticed </span> </span> the place was slow and quiet ; only two or three other parties were dining – not bad. We were cordially <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze4"> seated at the booth RIGHT next to the main entrance, even though all the other parties were seated in the back near the kitchen </span>. Both of us wanted to go to another booth, but the hostess claimed that we ’d be <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze5"> put into another section in which another waiter already had two tables </span>. Our <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze6"> booth </span> didn't make much sense to me, logistically. I figured we ’d be <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze7"> closer to the kitchen </span> or <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze8"> grouped somewhat close to the other parties </span>. Anyway we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze9"> said, "Hmm, no big deal </span>," and <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze10"> went about sitting </span>. On another note it was chilly that day, so every time the door opened we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze11"> felt a rush of cold air </span>. Not even after a minute (literally) of getting our <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze12"> menus </span>, the waitress asked if we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze13"> wanted drinks </span> and if we were <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze14"> ready to order the entrées </span>. I said that we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze15"> wanted drinks and an appetizer, first </span>. Fortunately, we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze16"> knew what entrées we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze17"> wanted </span> (my friend told me of their house burger) </span>. We <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze18"> went ahead </span> and <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze19"> gave our <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze20"> entrée orders </span> anyway while she was at the table </span>.

By this time we ’ve been <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze30"> waiting on our <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze31"> final bill </span> for about 20 minutes </span>.... I urged that we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze32"> called before eating here to ensure the card was active </span> and <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze33"> had a $ 25 balance </span>. My patience was growing thin especially after waiting 30 minutes for our <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze34"> final bill </span>, even though we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze35"> were seated, </span> ordered, and <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze36"> finished our <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze37"> meal </span> in 20 </span>.... In the end, we <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze38"> left a $ 4 tip </span>.... We <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze39"> called the number on the gift card, again, when we were <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze40"> driving home </span> </span>. The rep <span class="cloze document034 chain4 cloze41"> told us that the restaurant has a hotline to call to manually punch in the card number in case </span> it doesn't swipe into the system.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain7"><p>... We had a gift card for $ 25 and our meal was for <span class="cloze document034 chain7 cloze0"> $ 40 </span> (not including tip). I had some cash in my wallet that I planned on using, though it was not enough to <span class="cloze document034 chain7 cloze1"> cover the full meal </span>, but enough to cover the difference left over from using the gift card plus tip.... My patience was growing thin especially after waiting 30 minutes for our final bill, even though we were seated, ordered, and <span class="cloze document034 chain7 cloze2"> finished our meal in 20 </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain8"><p>... Finally, after another 10 minutes, she comes back saying the card was declined again and to <span class="cloze document034 chain8 cloze0"> call the number </span>.... We <span class="cloze document034 chain8 cloze1"> called the number on the gift card, again, when we were driving home </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain9"><p>... Overall the service was <span class="cloze document034 chain9 cloze0"> unusually fast </span> and the food was great. But then it <span class="cloze document034 chain9 cloze1"> goes downhill </span>.... Usually I ’m a happy tipper (giving at least 20-25 % if the service isn't <span class="cloze document034 chain9 cloze2"> horrendous </span>).... </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain10"><p>... Not even after a minute (literally) of getting our menus, the waitress asked if we wanted drinks and if we were ready to <span class="cloze document034 chain10 cloze0"> order the entrées </span>.... Then, a runner swoops in with the entrées just seconds after our appetizer was delivered. No big concern ; however, the whole point of our appetizer was to munch for a bit of time before the entrées <span class="cloze document034 chain10 cloze1"> arrived </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document034 chain11"><p>... We <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze0"> had a gift card for $ 25 </span> and our meal was for $ 40 (not including tip). I had some cash in my wallet that I planned on using, though it was not enough to cover the full meal, but enough to cover the difference left over from <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze1"> using the gift card plus tip </span> </span>. I <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze2"> gave the waitress the gift card </span> and asked her to <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze3"> run it through to make sure that it <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze4"> worked </span> (I didn't want to stiff them in case it was <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze5"> declined </span>) </span>. Sure enough, she comes back saying it is <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze6"> declined </span> and that the system may be down and that we needed to wait a while for the system to reboot.... Finally, after another 10 minutes, she comes back saying the card was <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze7"> declined again </span> and to call the number. I urged that we called before eating here to ensure the card was <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze8"> active </span> and had a $ 25 balance.... I didn't have enough cash to pay in full, so I reluctantly <span class="cloze document034 chain11 cloze9"> handed over my debit card </span>.... We called the number on the gift card, again, when we were driving home.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document035 chain0"><p>... They were having a special and they <span class="cloze document035 chain0 cloze0"> had a dessert that was only available for a certain time </span> and it <span class="cloze document035 chain0 cloze1"> sounded divine </span>.... When it came time to order dessert, I <span class="cloze document035 chain0 cloze2"> ordered the special dessert only to be told that they were out of it </span>.... The special dessert !... </p></div>

<div class="chain document035 chain1"><p>... The food was <span class="cloze document035 chain1 cloze0"> good </span>, but our waiter basically ignored us in favor of serving the other tables who were racking up huge drink tabs. When it <span class="cloze document035 chain1 cloze1"> came time to order dessert </span>, I ordered the special dessert only to be told that they were out of it.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document035 chain2"><p>... We <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze0"> went on a Saturday night </span> but were <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze1"> seated fairly quickly </span>. We <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze2"> ordered our <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze3"> drinks </span> (we <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze4"> both ordered sodas, we ’re not <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze5"> drinkers </span> </span>) and our <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze6"> meals </span> </span>. The food was good, but our <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze7"> waiter </span> basically <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze8"> ignored us in favor of serving the other tables who were racking up huge drink tabs </span>.... I ordered something else, but what did I see someone else being delivered after we <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze9"> got ours </span> </span>?... The last straw was when we <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze10"> asked for our <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze11"> bill </span>, the server didn't even stop to hand it to us </span> – they threw it on our <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze12"> table </span>. I don't recall what we <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze13"> left as a tip, if anything </span>. But I wrote an email to corporate letting them know what happened and we were <span class="cloze document035 chain2 cloze14"> sent gift cards </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document035 chain3"><p>... The last straw was when we asked for our bill, the server didn't even stop to <span class="cloze document035 chain3 cloze0"> hand it to us </span> – they <span class="cloze document035 chain3 cloze1"> threw it on our table </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document035 chain4"><p>... My biggest problem with <span class="cloze document035 chain4 cloze0"> servers at places where there's a bar is when they ignore people who don't drink </span> in favor of tables in whichÂ all they <span class="cloze document035 chain4 cloze1"> do </span> is drink. </p></div>

<div class="chain document035 chain5"><p> My <span class="cloze document035 chain5 cloze0"> husband </span> and I <span class="cloze document035 chain5 cloze1"> went to a well-known chain restaurant in Pennsylvania for dinner 5 years or so ago </span>.... When it came time to order dessert, I <span class="cloze document035 chain5 cloze2"> ordered the special dessert only to be told that they were out of it </span>. I <span class="cloze document035 chain5 cloze3"> ordered something else </span>, but what did I <span class="cloze document035 chain5 cloze4"> see someone else being delivered after we got ours </span>?... I don't <span class="cloze document035 chain5 cloze5"> recall what we left as a tip, if anything </span>. But I <span class="cloze document035 chain5 cloze6"> wrote an email to corporate letting them know what happened </span> and we were sent gift cards. My <span class="cloze document035 chain5 cloze7"> biggest problem </span> with servers at places where there's a bar is when they ignore people who don't drink in favor of tables in whichÂ all they do is drink. </p></div>

<div class="chain document035 chain6"><p> My husband and I <span class="cloze document035 chain6 cloze0"> went to a well-known chain restaurant in Pennsylvania for dinner 5 years or so ago </span> </span>. They were <span class="cloze document035 chain6 cloze1"> having a special </span> and they <span class="cloze document035 chain6 cloze2"> had a dessert that was only available for a certain time </span> and it sounded divine.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document037 chain0"><p>... We <span class="cloze document037 chain0 cloze0"> asked our waiter if the sound could be turned down </span> ; he <span class="cloze document037 chain0 cloze1"> said he ’d <span class="cloze document037 chain0 cloze2"> ask </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document037 chain0 cloze3"> left </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document037 chain1"><p>... The volume was <span class="cloze document037 chain1 cloze0"> so high </span> that we had to nearly shout to hear each other across a very small table.... A couple of minutes later a manager came to our table and told us condescendingly that they would not <span class="cloze document037 chain1 cloze1"> change the volume </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document037 chain2"><p> My <span class="cloze document037 chain2 cloze0"> wife </span> and I were <span class="cloze document037 chain2 cloze1"> looking for a quiet pub to have monthly casual dinners with another couple </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document037 chain3"><p>... A couple of minutes later a manager came to our table and told us condescendingly that they would not <span class="cloze document037 chain3 cloze0"> change the volume </span>.... It was a pub and they <span class="cloze document037 chain3 cloze1"> had to "maintain the ambiance </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document037 chain4"><p>... So we were <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze0"> delighted when we <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze1"> heard about a pub which had a separate room without a TV, an area they called "The Library </span> </span>." Before we <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze2"> took our <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze3"> friends </span> </span> we <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze4"> decided to try it ourselves </span> and <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze5"> went for dinner, specifying we <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze6"> wanted that room </span> </span>.... The volume was so high that we <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze7"> had to nearly shout to hear each other across a very small table </span>. We <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze8"> asked our <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze9"> waiter </span> if the sound could be turned down </span> ; he said he ’d ask and left. A couple of minutes later a manager came to our <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze10"> table </span> and <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze11"> told us condescendingly that they would not change the volume </span>.... We <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze12"> crossed that pub off our <span class="cloze document037 chain4 cloze13"> list </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document038 chain0"><p>... While she was gone the waiter, who was working the area by himself, came over to <span class="cloze document038 chain0 cloze0"> take our order </span>.... He looked confused when I told him that he had <span class="cloze document038 chain0 cloze1"> taken our order </span>, but the runner was right behind him with two plates. He finally believed that he had <span class="cloze document038 chain0 cloze2"> taken the order </span> and got my wife her coffee, but never brought me my drink.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document038 chain1"><p>... The hostess seated us on the patio ; due to cool weather we were only the third table (of nine) to <span class="cloze document038 chain1 cloze0"> have patrons </span>. One of the others was finishing up before paying their <span class="cloze document038 chain1 cloze1"> check </span>, the other was in mid-meal.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document038 chain2"><p>... The hostess <span class="cloze document038 chain2 cloze0"> seated us on the patio </span> ; due to cool weather we were <span class="cloze document038 chain2 cloze1"> only the third table </span> (of nine) to have patrons.... While she was gone the waiter, who was working the area by himself, came over to take our <span class="cloze document038 chain2 cloze2"> order </span>.... After my wife returned the waiter came over and asked if we ’d be <span class="cloze document038 chain2 cloze3"> ordering food or just drinking </span>. He looked confused when I told him that he had taken our <span class="cloze document038 chain2 cloze4"> order </span>, but the runner was right behind him with two plates.... For the rest of the meal the server went to the other two tables several times to check on them but <span class="cloze document038 chain2 cloze5"> ignored us </span>. I had to almost grab him to get his attention to bring us salt and pepper. At the end of the meal our <span class="cloze document038 chain2 cloze6"> bill </span> came to $ 31.25.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document038 chain3"><p>... My wife and I <span class="cloze document038 chain3 cloze0"> stopped at a popular restaurant for Sunday brunch </span>.... My wife <span class="cloze document038 chain3 cloze1"> looked at the menu </span> and <span class="cloze document038 chain3 cloze2"> told me that she <span class="cloze document038 chain3 cloze3"> wanted an omelet and coffee </span> </span>, then left to freshen up. While she was gone the waiter, </span> who was working the area by himself, came over to take our order.... After my wife <span class="cloze document038 chain3 cloze4"> returned </span> the waiter came over and asked if we ’d be ordering food or just drinking.... He finally believed that he had taken the order and <span class="cloze document038 chain3 cloze5"> got my wife </span> her <span class="cloze document038 chain3 cloze6"> coffee </span>, but never brought me my drink.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document038 chain4"><p> I <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze0"> under-tipped recently </span> and <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze1"> wanted to share my <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze2"> story </span> </span>. My <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze3"> wife </span> and I <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze4"> stopped at a popular restaurant for Sunday brunch </span>.... My <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze5"> wife </span> looked at the menu and <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze6"> told me that she wanted an omelet and coffee </span>, then left to freshen up.... I <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze7"> gave him the two orders, which he didn't write down </span>, and he left. After my <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze8"> wife </span> returned the waiter came over and asked if we ’d be ordering food or just drinking.

I <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze13"> had to almost grab him to get his attention to bring us salt and pepper </span>.... I <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze14"> had exact change </span> and <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze15"> debated about the tip </span>, but in the end I <span class="cloze document038 chain4 cloze16"> threw down $ 4 figuring he ’d been embarrassed by his earlier faux pas </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document038 chain5"><p>... While she was gone the waiter, </span> </span> who was working the area by himself, came over to take our order. I gave him the two orders, which he didn't <span class="cloze document038 chain5 cloze0"> write down </span>, and he <span class="cloze document038 chain5 cloze1"> left </span>.

<div class="chain document039 chain0"><p>... We must have sat there for 20 minutes before we even <span class="cloze document039 chain0 cloze0"> saw a server </span>.... The server <span class="cloze document039 chain0 cloze1"> went to a table in the opposite corner </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain0 cloze2"> started to roll silverware </span>.... So I told my friend to close her menu so the server would <span class="cloze document039 chain0 cloze3"> get the hint </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain1"><p>... She went over to <span class="cloze document039 chain1 cloze0"> print our check </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain1 cloze1"> slammed it on the table </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain2"><p>... I said, "Yeah, I don't <span class="cloze document039 chain2 cloze0"> like eggs </span>, so she <span class="cloze document039 chain2 cloze1"> eats them </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain3"><p> A friend and I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze0"> went to a well known pancake house often, at least once a week </span>.... My <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze1"> friend </span> said, "We will both have coffee, please."... When she came back 10 minutes later with our drinks I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze2"> asked if we could have menus </span>. She said, "Why <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze3"> didn't you </span> tell me that when I got your <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze4"> drink order </span>?"... We both looked at each other in shock and before I could <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze5"> say </span> anything she walked away again.... OK, when she said this I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze6"> thought she would give us time to look at the menus </span>, but it was literally seconds when she came back. She looked at my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze7"> friend </span> and said, "What are you having?" My <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze8"> friend </span> looked at me then <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze9"> looked back at the waitress </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze10"> said </span>, "I don't <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze11"> know </span>, I haven't <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze12"> had time to look </span>."... My <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze13"> friend </span> said, "Uh, yeah." My <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze14"> friend </span> was being kind of rude at this point.... I ’m <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze15"> guessing we came in towards the end of her shift </span> ; I don't <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze16"> know </span>.... About 15 minutes went by, we were obviously in no big hurry, a couple of chatty girls like ourselves can make some time pass, but I was <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze17"> really hungry </span>. So I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze18"> told my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze19"> friend to close her menu so the server would get the hint </span> </span>.... So my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze20"> friend </span> says, "We ’re ready."... She gets her paper and pen out and just stares at my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze21"> friend </span>. My <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze22"> friend </span> says, "OK, I guess I ’ll go first." She orders her food and then it's my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze23"> turn </span> ; I ’m <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze24"> a little nervous at this point </span>.... I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze25"> order the same thing every time </span>. It is an egg platter, but I do not <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze26"> like eggs </span>. I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze27"> eat the bacon, hash browns, and pancakes that come with the meal </span> and my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze28"> friend </span> eats the eggs.... I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze29"> said, "Yeah </span>, I don't like eggs, so she eats them."... I really didn't <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze30"> want to argue with the woman, so I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze31"> said </span>," OK, if you could just leave the eggs on the platter </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze32"> bring me </span> </span> an extra plate, please." I was <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze33"> thinking why does it matter to you what I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze34"> do </span> </span>. I wouldn't <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze35"> think it would be that hard to bring a small plate or even a saucer </span>. Something so my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze36"> friend </span> doesn't have to eat her eggs off the table.... I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze37"> said, "<span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze38"> Excuse me </span> </span>, can I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze39"> have an extra plate please </span>?"... At this point my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze40"> friend </span> is mad.... I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze41"> heard the kitchen door slam </span>.... She came out and told my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze42"> friend </span> how rude she was and customers were not allowed in that area and we should pay our bill and leave.... I was <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze43"> shocked !! </span> Yes, my <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze44"> friend </span> should not have done that, but in all fairness the expo window is clearly visible and we knew she wasn't going to bring the plate. So anyways, we got up to leave and I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze45"> looked at the bill </span> ; she <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze46"> charged me al a carte for all of my food </span> ! My <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze47"> friend </span> said, "Let's just go we didn't even take a bite." Even after everything this crazy lady did I couldn't not <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze48"> pay the bill </span>. The bill was $ 27.94 or something like that ; I <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze49"> left $ 28 on the table </span>. I ’m still in <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze50"> shock </span> to this day. I have never <span class="cloze document039 chain3 cloze51"> seen anything like this </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain4"><p>... She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze0"> finally came over </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze1"> said, "What do you want to drink?" </span> My friend <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze2"> said, "We will both have coffee </span>, please." She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze3"> turned and walked away without saying a word </span> </span>. When she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze4"> came back 10 minutes later with our drinks </span> I asked if we could have menus. She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze5"> said, "Why didn't you tell me that when I <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze6"> got </span> your drink order?" </span> like she was <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze7"> mad at us </span>. We both looked at each other in shock and before I could say anything she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze8"> walked away again </span>. She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze9"> slid the menus on the table almost like a toss and said, "I ’ll <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze10"> be back </span> </span>." OK, when she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze11"> said this </span> I thought she would <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze12"> give us time to look at the menus </span>, but it was literally seconds when she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze13"> came back </span>. She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze14"> looked at my friend </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze15"> said, "What are you <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze16"> having </span>?" </span> My friend <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze17"> looked at me then looked back at the waitress and said, "I don't know </span>, I haven't had time to look." She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze18"> said, "More time then </span>?"... My friend <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze19"> said, "Uh, yeah </span>." My friend was being <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze20"> kind </span> of rude at this point.... I ’m guessing we came in towards the end of her <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze21"> shift </span> ; I don't know.... So I <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze22"> told my friend to close her <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze23"> menu </span> so the server would get the hint </span>. She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze24"> closed her <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze25"> menu </span> and more time passed </span>. Did she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze26"> get the hint </span>?... So my friend <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze27"> says, "We ’re ready </span>." She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze28"> slams the silverware on the table </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze29"> comes over </span>. She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze30"> gets her <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze31"> paper and pen </span> out </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze32"> just stares at my friend </span>. My friend <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze33"> says, "OK, I <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze34"> guess I ’ll <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze35"> go first </span> </span> </span>." She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze36"> orders her <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze37"> food </span> </span> and then it's my turn ; I ’m a little nervous at this point. This lady is flat-out <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze38"> mean </span>.... I eat the bacon, hash browns, and pancakes that come with the meal and my friend <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze39"> eats the eggs </span>.... She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze40"> said, "Separate plate </span>?" I said, "Yeah, I don't like eggs, so she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze41"> eats them </span>." Then she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze42"> said, "Well </span> then you shouldn't get an egg platter, you should order a la carte." I really didn't want to argue with the woman, so I said," OK, if you could just leave the eggs on the platter and bring me an extra plate, please."... Something so my friend doesn't <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze43"> have to eat her <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze44"> eggs </span> off the table </span>. She was <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze45"> eating French toast so there was no room on her <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze46"> plate </span> </span>. About 30 minutes later here she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze47"> comes with our food </span> and she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze48"> puts it down </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze49"> proceeded to walk away </span>.... She just <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze50"> kept walking </span>. At this point my friend is <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze51"> mad </span>. She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze52"> gets up </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze53"> walks right up to the expo window </span> and asks the cook for a plate. The waitress must have <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze54"> heard her </span> or the cook <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze55"> told her because she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze56"> came from the back very angry </span> </span>.... She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze57"> came out </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze58"> told my friend how rude she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze59"> was </span> and customers were not allowed in that area </span> </span> and we should pay our bill and leave. She <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze60"> went over to print our check </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze61"> slammed it on the table </span>.... Yes, my friend should not have <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze62"> done that </span>, but in all fairness the expo window is clearly visible and we knew she wasn't <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze63"> going to bring the plate </span>. So anyways, we got up to leave and I looked at the bill ; she <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze64"> charged me al a carte for all of my food </span> ! My friend <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze65"> said, "Let's just go we didn't even take a bite </span>." Even after everything this crazy lady <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze66"> did I couldn't not pay the bill </span>.... This lady was <span class="cloze document039 chain4 cloze67"> terrible !! </span>... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain5"><p>... It was right down the street from our <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze0"> houses </span>. We <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze1"> had a few issues in the past </span>, but nothing to the extreme that we would never <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze2"> come back (obviously) </span>. We <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze3"> came in one morning around 2 a.m. just getting off work </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze4"> decided to drink coffee and unwind </span>.... We <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze5"> sat at our <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze6"> regular table </span> in the back </span>. By the way, we were <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze7"> the only 2 people </span> in the dining room. We must have <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze8"> sat there for 20 minutes before we even <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze9"> saw a server </span> </span>.... My friend said, "We <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze10"> will </span> both have coffee, please."... When she came back 10 minutes later with our <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze11"> drinks </span> I asked if we could <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze12"> have menus </span>.... like she was mad at us. We both <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze13"> looked at each other in shock and before I could say anything she walked away again </span>.... OK, when she said this I thought she would give us time to look at the menus, but it was literally seconds when she came back.... I ’m guessing we <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze14"> came in towards the end of her shift </span> ; I don't know. So anyways we both <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze15"> decide what we <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze16"> want within 5 minutes or so </span> </span>. About 15 minutes went by, we were obviously in <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze17"> no big hurry </span>, a couple of chatty girls like ourselves can <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze18"> make some time pass </span>, but I was really hungry.... About 30 minutes later here she comes with our <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze19"> food </span> and she puts it down and proceeded to walk away.... She came out and told my friend how rude she was and customers were not allowed in that area and we should <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze20"> pay our <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze21"> bill and leave </span> </span>. She went over to print our <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze22"> check </span> and slammed it on the table.... Yes, my friend should not have done that, but in all fairness the expo window is clearly visible and we <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze23"> knew she wasn't going to bring the plate </span>. So anyways, we <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze24"> got up to leave </span> and I looked at the bill ; she charged me al a carte for all of my food !... Needless to <span class="cloze document039 chain5 cloze25"> say we </span> found a different 24 hour diner to unwind at after work. </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain6"><p>... So I told my friend to close her menu so the server would <span class="cloze document039 chain6 cloze0"> get the hint </span>.... Did she <span class="cloze document039 chain6 cloze1"> get the hint </span>?... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain7"><p>... She slid the menus on the table almost like a <span class="cloze document039 chain7 cloze0"> toss </span> and <span class="cloze document039 chain7 cloze1"> said, "I ’ll be back </span>." OK, when she said this I thought she would give us time to look at the menus, but it was literally seconds when she came back.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain8"><p>... So I told my friend to <span class="cloze document039 chain8 cloze0"> close her menu so the server would get the hint </span>. She <span class="cloze document039 chain8 cloze1"> closed her menu and more time passed </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain9"><p>... So anyways, we got up to leave and I looked at the bill ; she charged me al a carte for all of my food !... Even after everything this crazy lady did I couldn't not <span class="cloze document039 chain9 cloze0"> pay the bill </span>. The bill was <span class="cloze document039 chain9 cloze1"> $ 27.94 </span> or something like that ; I left $ 28 on the table.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain10"><p>... So I say, "Can I <span class="cloze document039 chain10 cloze0"> get my <span class="cloze document039 chain10 cloze1"> eggs </span> scrambled with cheese on a separate plate </span>?"... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain11"><p>... It is an egg platter, but I do not <span class="cloze document039 chain11 cloze0"> like eggs </span>. I eat the bacon, hash browns, and pancakes that come with the meal and my friend <span class="cloze document039 chain11 cloze1"> eats the eggs </span>.... So I say, "Can I get my eggs <span class="cloze document039 chain11 cloze2"> scrambled with cheese on a separate plate </span>?"... I really didn't want to argue with the woman, so I said," OK, if you could just <span class="cloze document039 chain11 cloze3"> leave the eggs on the platter </span> and bring me an extra plate, please."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain12"><p>... I <span class="cloze document039 chain12 cloze0"> order the same thing every time </span>. It is <span class="cloze document039 chain12 cloze1"> an egg platter </span>, but I do not like eggs.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain13"><p>... Then she said, "Well then you shouldn't <span class="cloze document039 chain13 cloze0"> get an egg platter </span>, you should <span class="cloze document039 chain13 cloze1"> order a la carte </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document039 chain14"><p>... She gets up and walks right up to the expo window and <span class="cloze document039 chain14 cloze0"> asks the cook for a plate </span>. The waitress must have heard her or the cook <span class="cloze document039 chain14 cloze1"> told her because she came from the back very angry </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document041 chain0"><p>... The female cashier came over and <span class="cloze document041 chain0 cloze0"> corrected it </span> and explained to the male cashier why it was <span class="cloze document041 chain0 cloze1"> incorrect </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document041 chain1"><p> I <span class="cloze document041 chain1 cloze0"> placed an order over the phone at "PW" Asian Diner in Dulles, Virginia </span>. Iâ   m already in their system as they recognized my call back number and pick up name and even my order.... I waited about 15 more minutes because they <span class="cloze document041 chain1 cloze1"> messed up the order </span>. Even when I <span class="cloze document041 chain1 cloze2"> received it </span>, it still wasn't <span class="cloze document041 chain1 cloze3"> correct </span> (I asked for the rice on the side).... </p></div>

<div class="chain document041 chain2"><p> I <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze0"> placed an order over the phone at "PW" Asian Diner in Dulles, Virginia </span>. Iâ   m already in their system as they recognized my <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze1"> call </span> back number and pick up name and even my <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze2"> order </span>. When I <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze3"> got there 10 minutes later it wasn't ready </span>, plus they tried to charge me <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze4"> extra for some reason </span>.... I <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze5"> waited about 15 more minutes because they messed up the order </span>. Even when I <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze6"> received it </span>, it still wasn't correct (I <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze7"> asked for the rice on the side </span>). When I <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze8"> asked for a bag to put the food in the cashier </span> gave me attitude and decided he wanted to fight me <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze9"> stating that he didn't care since it was his last day </span>.... He then <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze10"> followed me outside </span> and continued to <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze11"> antagonize me </span> and even threatened to <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze12"> shoot me </span>.... I <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze13"> used to be a regular </span>.... I <span class="cloze document041 chain2 cloze14"> think his name is "C" </span> and he was the only male cashier at the time.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document041 chain3"><p>... The female cashier <span class="cloze document041 chain3 cloze0"> came over </span> and <span class="cloze document041 chain3 cloze1"> corrected it </span> and <span class="cloze document041 chain3 cloze2"> explained to the male cashier why it was incorrect </span>.... When I asked for a bag to put the food in the cashier gave me attitude and decided he wanted to fight me stating that he didn't care since it was his last day.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document041 chain4"><p>... When I asked for a bag to put the food in the cashier gave me attitude and decided he <span class="cloze document041 chain4 cloze0"> wanted to fight me stating that he didn't <span class="cloze document041 chain4 cloze1"> care since it was his <span class="cloze document041 chain4 cloze2"> last day </span> </span> </span>.... He then <span class="cloze document041 chain4 cloze3"> followed me outside </span> and <span class="cloze document041 chain4 cloze4"> continued to antagonize me </span> and even <span class="cloze document041 chain4 cloze5"> threatened to shoot me </span>. Finally one of the kitchen employees came and <span class="cloze document041 chain4 cloze6"> got him </span>.... I think his <span class="cloze document041 chain4 cloze7"> name </span> is "C" and he was <span class="cloze document041 chain4 cloze8"> the only male cashier </span> at the time.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document041 chain5"><p>... Iâ   m already in their <span class="cloze document041 chain5 cloze0"> system </span> as they recognized my call back number and pick up name and even my order. When I got there 10 minutes later it wasn't ready, plus they <span class="cloze document041 chain5 cloze1"> tried to charge me extra for some reason </span>.... I waited about 15 more minutes because they <span class="cloze document041 chain5 cloze2"> messed up the order </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain0"><p>... Another waitress then walked into the kitchen with the photo lady's half-eaten salmon dish, saying that the lady had spilled her champagne all over it and would <span class="cloze document043 chain0 cloze0"> like a new meal </span>.... This immediately rang alarm bells in my head, but the chef still prepared her a salad and <span class="cloze document043 chain0 cloze1"> sent it out </span>. From the kitchen, I saw the waitress <span class="cloze document043 chain0 cloze2"> take the meal over to the photo lady </span> and she seemed uninterested when it <span class="cloze document043 chain0 cloze3"> arrived </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain1"><p>... Five minutes later – she finally seemed happy with the photos so I went on my way to deliver the cake to my table (it had been about 10 minutes since they <span class="cloze document043 chain1 cloze0"> requested the cake </span>, but they weren't <span class="cloze document043 chain1 cloze1"> upset since they <span class="cloze document043 chain1 cloze2"> saw that I got caught up and understood </span> </span>).... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain2"><p>... This infuriated me even more, but I remained calm and replied, Â "I ’m sorry ma’am, but I was in the kitchen when I saw your meal <span class="cloze document043 chain2 cloze0"> leave steaming hot </span> and it has been <span class="cloze document043 chain2 cloze1"> sitting on your table for over 20 minutes </span>, so there's not much I can do about that."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain3"><p>... On my way I was stopped by a lady who was dining alone and seemed like a tourist. She <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze0"> wanted me to take a photo of her at her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze1"> table </span>, which is a very normal request since our venue has very nice views by the window </span>. I stopped and took a few photos and handed her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze2"> back </span> the camera.... I turned around – it was the photo lady again.... She <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze3"> tapped my shoulder again, clearly ignoring what I had just said and interrupted my conversation with the other table to complain about the photos I just took </span>. I had just finished talking with the other table, so I turned to her and <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze4"> asked her what the problem was </span>. She <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze5"> picked up her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze6"> camera </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze7"> pointed at one of the photos </span>. "See here, you can't see the salmon on my <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze8"> plate </span>.... I <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze9"> want to be able to see the salmon on my <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze10"> plate </span> </span>."... Five minutes later – she <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze11"> finally seemed happy with the photos so I went on my way to deliver the cake to my table (it had been about 10 minutes since they requested the cake, but they weren't upset since they saw that I got caught up and understood) </span>. As I was walking over, I <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze12"> saw the photo lady out of the corner of my eye getting one of my co-workers to take more photos of her </span>. I was really frustrated since she had just <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze13"> wasted my time with these photos which now seemed even more pointless, plus the restaurant was still quite busy </span>.... About 15 minutes later I happened to walk past her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze14"> table </span> again and noticed that she had now <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze15"> asked one of the OTHER DINERS to take photos of her </span>.... She <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze16"> asked the male patron to follow her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze17"> outside </span> and take photos of her (I ’m sure he was trying to be polite) leaving his female companion to dine alone </span>.... Another waitress <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze18"> then walked into the kitchen with the photo lady's <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze19"> half-eaten salmon dish </span>, saying that the lady had <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze20"> spilled her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze21"> champagne </span> all over it </span> </span> and would <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze22"> like a new meal </span>.... The waitress then <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze23"> added, "Oh </span>, but this time she would <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze24"> like salad instead of chips </span>." This immediately rang alarm bells in my head, but the chef still prepared her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze25"> a salad </span> and sent it out. From the kitchen, I saw the waitress <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze26"> take the meal over to the photo lady </span> and she <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze27"> seemed uninterested when it arrived </span>. I thought that this was very rude after she <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze28"> had practically just received a free meal without a hassle </span>. Some more time had passed and my large table had all finished their meals when I noticed that the photo lady had BARELY <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze29"> touched her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze30"> meal </span> </span> and was just playing on her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze31"> phone </span>. I walked over to her and <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze32"> asked her if everything was okay with her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze33"> meal </span> </span>.... The salmon is cold," she <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze34"> said bluntly </span>.... "Oh," she <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze35"> said </span>, disappointed. She then <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze36"> began to slowly eat her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze37"> meal </span> visibly annoyed and pouting like a child </span>. At this point the lady had been here for <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze38"> 2 hours </span>. She hadn't <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze39"> had any other food except this salmon dish </span> and the service was quite fast that day.... Finally she had <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze40"> finished </span> and was about to leave. She <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze41"> got up to pay </span> and I was nearby when I heard the conversation she <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze42"> had with the manager </span> who was fixing up her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze43"> bill </span>. She basically <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze44"> argued that her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze45"> glass </span> of champagne should be taken off the bill since she had <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze46"> spilled it on her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze47"> meal </span> (she <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze48"> had drunk half of it anyway </span>) </span> </span>. My manager calmly <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze49"> told her that it wasn't the restaurant's responsibility for the spillage and that he couldn't take it off </span>. She <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze50"> seemed very annoyed </span>, continued to argue her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze51"> point </span>, but she eventually <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze52"> paid </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze53"> left </span>. A while later one of the other waitresses revealed to me that she had <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze54"> witnessed the lady <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze55"> purposely knock the almost finished glass of champagne over her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze56"> half-eaten meal </span> </span> </span>, so it was clear that she was just <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze57"> trying to scam us into giving her a free meal and drink </span>. She was easily among <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze58"> the most irritating customers </span> I have ever experienced – and I hope all her <span class="cloze document043 chain3 cloze59"> 1000 photos </span> turned out terrible. </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain4"><p>... She <span class="cloze document043 chain4 cloze0"> asked the male patron to follow her outside and take photos of her (I ’m sure he was <span class="cloze document043 chain4 cloze1"> trying to be polite </span>) leaving his <span class="cloze document043 chain4 cloze2"> female companion </span> to dine alone </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain5"><p>... "Please <span class="cloze document043 chain5 cloze0"> take some portrait shots too </span>. They are for <span class="cloze document043 chain5 cloze1"> my family </span> overseas so I <span class="cloze document043 chain5 cloze2"> want them to be nice </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain6"><p>... "See here, you can't <span class="cloze document043 chain6 cloze0"> see the salmon on my plate </span>.... Can you <span class="cloze document043 chain6 cloze1"> please take another photo </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain7"><p>... This infuriated me even more, but I remained calm and replied, Â "I ’m sorry ma’am, but I was in the kitchen when I saw your <span class="cloze document043 chain7 cloze0"> meal </span> leave steaming hot and it has been sitting on your <span class="cloze document043 chain7 cloze1"> table </span> for over 20 minutes, so there's not much I can do about that."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain8"><p>... I stopped and took a few photos and <span class="cloze document043 chain8 cloze0"> handed her back the camera </span>.... She <span class="cloze document043 chain8 cloze1"> picked up her camera </span> and pointed at one of the photos.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain9"><p>... I thought that this was very rude after she had practically just <span class="cloze document043 chain9 cloze0"> received a free meal without a hassle </span>. Some more time had passed and my large table had all finished their meals when I noticed that the photo lady had BARELY <span class="cloze document043 chain9 cloze1"> touched her meal </span> and was just playing on her phone. I walked over to her and asked her if everything was okay with her meal.... She then began to <span class="cloze document043 chain9 cloze2"> slowly eat her meal </span> visibly annoyed and pouting like a child.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain10"><p>... "See here, you can't <span class="cloze document043 chain10 cloze0"> see the salmon on my plate </span>.... I want to be able to <span class="cloze document043 chain10 cloze1"> see the salmon on my plate </span>."... The salmon is <span class="cloze document043 chain10 cloze2"> cold </span>," she said bluntly.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain11"><p>... Some more time had passed and my large table had all <span class="cloze document043 chain11 cloze0"> finished their <span class="cloze document043 chain11 cloze1"> meals </span> when I noticed that the photo lady had BARELY touched her meal </span> and was just playing on her phone.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain12"><p>... The other diners had JUST <span class="cloze document043 chain12 cloze0"> received their meals </span> and it seemed as though they were on a date.... Some more time had passed and my large table had all <span class="cloze document043 chain12 cloze1"> finished their meals when I noticed that the photo lady had BARELY touched her meal </span> and was just playing on her phone.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain13"><p>... The other diners had JUST <span class="cloze document043 chain13 cloze0"> received their <span class="cloze document043 chain13 cloze1"> meals </span> </span> and it seemed as though they were on <span class="cloze document043 chain13 cloze2"> a date </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain14"><p>... Another waitress then walked into the kitchen with the photo lady's half-eaten salmon dish, saying that the lady had spilled her champagne all over it and would like a new meal. The kitchen didn't <span class="cloze document043 chain14 cloze0"> skip a beat </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain14 cloze1"> began preparing one </span>.... From the kitchen, I saw the waitress take the meal over to the photo lady and she seemed uninterested when it arrived.... This infuriated me even more, but I remained calm and replied, Â "I ’m sorry ma’am, but I was in the kitchen when I saw your meal leave steaming hot and it has been sitting on your table for over 20 minutes, so there's not much I can do about that."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain15"><p> It was a Sunday afternoon which is generally a very busy time for the restaurant I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze0"> work at, as we receive a lot of lunch bookings </span>. I was <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze1"> serving two large tables who were both celebrating something </span>, so I really <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze2"> wanted to make sure that they received the best service </span>. I was in <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze3"> the process </span> of getting the birthday cake out of the fridge for one of the tables, ensuring that it was prompt since they had to leave soon. On my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze4"> way </span> I was <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze5"> stopped by a lady who was dining alone </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze6"> seemed like a tourist </span>. She <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze7"> wanted me to take a photo of her at her table, which is a very normal request since our venue has very nice views by the window </span>. I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze8"> stopped and took a few photos </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze9"> handed her back the camera </span>. I was then <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze10"> stopped by another table who had a quick question about the menu when I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze11"> felt a tap on my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze12"> shoulder </span> </span> </span>. I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze13"> turned around </span> – it was the photo lady again. I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze14"> said, "I ’m <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze15"> very sorry </span> </span>, I ’m with <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze16"> another customer </span> at the moment, but I ’ll be with <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze17"> you </span> shortly." She tapped my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze18"> shoulder </span> again, clearly ignoring what I had just <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze19"> said </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze20"> interrupted my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze21"> conversation </span> with the other table </span> to complain about the photos I just <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze22"> took </span>. I had just <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze23"> finished talking with the other table </span>, so I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze24"> turned to her </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze25"> asked her what the problem was </span>.... I was <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze26"> baffled at how idiotic this request was and annoyed since I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze27"> had my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze28"> birthday table </span> in mind </span> </span>, but I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze29"> took a few more photos anyway </span>.... I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze30"> asked </span>. (BIG MISTAKE) "Oh no, these are <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze31"> terrible </span>, you <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze32"> made me </span> look fat. <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze33"> Can you take more and make sure they are above the waist so I don't <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze34"> look fat </span> </span>." Â So again, I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze35"> took a few more </span>.... They are for my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze36"> family </span> overseas so I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze37"> want them to be nice </span>." Five minutes later – she finally seemed happy with the photos so I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze38"> went on my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze39"> way to deliver the cake to my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze40"> table </span> (it had been about 10 minutes since they requested the cake, but they weren't upset since they saw that I got <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze41"> caught up </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze42"> understood </span>) </span> </span>. As I was <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze43"> walking over </span>, I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze44"> saw the photo lady out of the corner of my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze45"> eye </span> getting one of my co-workers to take more photos of her </span>. I was <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze46"> really frustrated </span> since she had just wasted my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze47"> time </span> with these photos which now seemed even more pointless, plus the restaurant was still quite busy.... I just <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze48"> focused on my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze49"> tables </span> </span>. About 15 minutes later I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze50"> happened to walk past her table again </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze51"> noticed that she had now asked one of the OTHER DINERS to take photos of her </span>.... She asked the male patron to follow her outside and take photos of her (I ’m <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze52"> sure he was trying to be polite </span>) leaving his female companion to dine alone. I was <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze53"> infuriated </span>. Another 15 minutes had passed and I was in <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze54"> the kitchen </span> waiting as my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze55"> other </span> large table's meals were being plated up.... This immediately rang alarm bells in my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze56"> head </span>, but the chef still prepared her a salad and sent it out. From the kitchen, I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze57"> saw the waitress take the meal over to the photo lady </span> and she seemed uninterested when it arrived. I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze58"> thought that this was very rude after she had practically just received a free meal without a hassle </span>. Some more time had passed and my <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze59"> large table </span> had all finished their meals when I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze60"> noticed that the photo lady had BARELY touched her meal </span> and was just playing on her phone. I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze61"> walked over to her </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze62"> asked her if everything was okay with her meal </span>.... This infuriated me <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze63"> even more </span>, but I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze64"> remained calm </span> and <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze65"> replied </span>, Â "I ’m <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze66"> sorry ma’am </span>, but I was in <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze67"> the kitchen </span> when I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze68"> saw your meal leave steaming hot </span> and it has been sitting on your table for over 20 minutes, so there's not much I can <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze69"> do about that </span>."... I have <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze70"> seen people have 3 course meals in 2 hours </span>, so this was just ridiculous.... She got up to pay and I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze71"> was nearby when I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze72"> heard the conversation she had with the manager who was fixing up her bill </span> </span>.... My <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze73"> manager </span> calmly told her that it wasn't the restaurant's responsibility for the spillage and that he couldn't take it off.... A while later one of the other waitresses revealed to me that she had witnessed the lady purposely knock the almost finished glass of champagne over her half-eaten meal, so it was clear that she was just trying to scam us into giving her a free meal and drink. She was easily among the most irritating customers I have ever <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze74"> experienced </span> – and I <span class="cloze document043 chain15 cloze75"> hope all her 1000 photos turned out terrible </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain16"><p> It was a Sunday afternoon which is generally a very busy time for the restaurant I work at, as we <span class="cloze document043 chain16 cloze0"> receive a lot of lunch bookings </span>.... She wanted me to take a photo of her at her table, which is a very normal request since our <span class="cloze document043 chain16 cloze1"> venue </span> has very nice views by the window.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain17"><p>... I was serving two large tables who were both celebrating something, so I really wanted to make sure that they <span class="cloze document043 chain17 cloze0"> received the best service </span>. I was in the process of getting the birthday cake out of the fridge for one of the tables, ensuring that it was prompt since they <span class="cloze document043 chain17 cloze1"> had to leave soon </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain18"><p>... I was in the process of <span class="cloze document043 chain18 cloze0"> getting the birthday cake out of the fridge for one of the tables </span>, ensuring that it was prompt since they had to leave soon.... Five minutes later – she finally seemed happy with the photos so I went on my way to <span class="cloze document043 chain18 cloze1"> deliver the cake to my table (it had been about 10 minutes since they <span class="cloze document043 chain18 cloze2"> requested the cake </span>, but they weren't upset since they saw that I got caught up and understood) </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document043 chain19"><p>... She got up to pay and I was nearby when I heard the conversation she had with the manager who was <span class="cloze document043 chain19 cloze0"> fixing up her bill </span>. She basically argued that her glass of champagne should be <span class="cloze document043 chain19 cloze1"> taken off the bill since she had <span class="cloze document043 chain19 cloze2"> spilled it on her meal (she had drunk half of it anyway) </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document045 chain0"><p>... She once <span class="cloze document045 chain0 cloze0"> told me of a nightmare investigation in which she and her <span class="cloze document045 chain0 cloze1"> accomplices </span> <span class="cloze document045 chain0 cloze2"> made a horrifying and gruesome discovery in the kitchen of an Indian restaurant </span> </span>.... When she and her <span class="cloze document045 chain0 cloze3"> teammates </span> <span class="cloze document045 chain0 cloze4"> arrived to investigate </span>, what they found in there stunned them beyond belief.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document045 chain1"><p>... She once told me of a nightmare investigation in which she and her accomplices <span class="cloze document045 chain1 cloze0"> made a horrifying and gruesome discovery in the kitchen of an Indian restaurant </span> </span>.... When she and her teammates <span class="cloze document045 chain1 cloze1"> arrived to investigate </span> </span>, what they <span class="cloze document045 chain1 cloze2"> found in there <span class="cloze document045 chain1 cloze3"> stunned them beyond belief </span> </span>.... Apparently this establishment was a family business, and when one of their older members had passed away they simply didn't <span class="cloze document045 chain1 cloze4"> bother to get rid of the body </span> and <span class="cloze document045 chain1 cloze5"> left him there </span> in the corner.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document045 chain2"><p>... The place was <span class="cloze document045 chain2 cloze0"> shut down by the inspectors immediately </span> and the owners were banned from ever <span class="cloze document045 chain2 cloze1"> opening the place again </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document046 chain0"><p>... She says yes as she's hosting a birthday party and the rest are on <span class="cloze document046 chain0 cloze0"> their <span class="cloze document046 chain0 cloze1"> way </span> </span> inside with their <span class="cloze document046 chain0 cloze2"> parents </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document046 chain1"><p>... I ’m thinking she <span class="cloze document046 chain1 cloze0"> wants two kid's pack meals since I had been making those all day </span>. She then asks me to fill an order for 20 kid's pack meals.... The kid's pack meals <span class="cloze document046 chain1 cloze1"> contain a small drink, popcorn, and candy </span>.... About 10 minutes later, I <span class="cloze document046 chain1 cloze2"> had 20 kid's pack meals made and ready </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document046 chain2"><p>... All of which have to be individually poured, <span class="cloze document046 chain2 cloze0"> scooped </span>, and <span class="cloze document046 chain2 cloze1"> bagged </span>. Not to mention we have to assemble the trays for them too.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document046 chain3"><p> This is another story from my <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze0"> theater days </span> in the concession stand.... About halfway through my <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze1"> shift </span> I <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze2"> had a woman come up with two little girls </span>. I ’m <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze3"> thinking she wants two kid's pack meals since I had been <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze4"> making those all day </span> </span>. She then <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze5"> asks me to fill an order for 20 kid's pack meals </span>. I <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze6"> looked at her </span> and <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze7"> asked her, "Twenty kid's packs ma’am </span>?"... I <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze8"> looked </span> and <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze9"> saw that she wasn't kidding </span>.... I ’m not <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze10"> kidding </span>.... Needless to say, she was not happy over the logic that it would take more than 5 minutes, and was <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze11"> rushing me at every turn </span> and even remarked that she should come back and <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze12"> help me with her order </span>. Since there were other staff members who had orders to fill, I <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze13"> tried my <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze14"> best </span> to get all the drinks at the soda fountain as fast as I <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze15"> could </span> and <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze16"> had to get all the different candies </span> the kids wanted from the case </span>.... About 10 minutes later, I <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze17"> had 20 kid's pack meals made and ready </span>. This lady was still making remarks to me the whole time. After ringing her up, I <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze18"> told her we actually have a call-in service for large groups such as birthday parties </span>, and people can call in orders in advance so they would be ready upon arrival. She <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze19"> told me that sounded stupid </span>.... Thankfully, I never <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze20"> saw that woman again throughout my <span class="cloze document046 chain3 cloze21"> time </span> at the theater </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document046 chain4"><p> This is <span class="cloze document046 chain4 cloze0"> another story </span> from my theater days in the concession stand. This incident <span class="cloze document046 chain4 cloze1"> occurred during the release of Hannah Montana's 3D concert </span>. It was <span class="cloze document046 chain4 cloze2"> a REALLY </span> busy day as you can imagine.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document046 chain5"><p>... Not to mention we <span class="cloze document046 chain5 cloze0"> have to assemble the trays for them too </span>.... After ringing her up, I told her we actually <span class="cloze document046 chain5 cloze1"> have a call-in service for large groups such as birthday parties </span>, and people can call in orders in advance so they would be ready upon arrival.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document046 chain6"><p>... I ’m thinking she wants two kid's <span class="cloze document046 chain6 cloze0"> pack meals </span> since I had been making those all day. She then asks me to fill an order for 20 kid's <span class="cloze document046 chain6 cloze1"> pack meals </span>. I looked at her and asked her, "Twenty kid's <span class="cloze document046 chain6 cloze2"> packs </span> ma’am?"... The kid's <span class="cloze document046 chain6 cloze3"> pack meals </span> contain a small drink, popcorn, and candy.... About 10 minutes later, I had 20 kid's <span class="cloze document046 chain6 cloze4"> pack meals </span> made and ready.... </p></div>

Worst part was, she <span class="cloze document046 chain8 cloze7"> expected all this to be done within 5 minutes since she was <span class="cloze document046 chain8 cloze8"> running late </span> </span>.... Needless to say, she was not <span class="cloze document046 chain8 cloze9"> happy over the logic </span> that it would take more than 5 minutes, and was rushing me at every turn and <span class="cloze document046 chain8 cloze10"> even remarked that she should <span class="cloze document046 chain8 cloze11"> come back </span> and <span class="cloze document046 chain8 cloze12"> help me with her <span class="cloze document046 chain8 cloze13"> order </span> </span> </span>....

<div class="chain document047 chain0"><p> My <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze0"> father </span> and I were on <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze1"> our way </span> back from Florida.... My <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze2"> pancakes </span> were great, but as soon as my <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze3"> father </span> took a bite of his eggs, he pulled back, eyes tearing up, hands over his mouth. I <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze4"> asked him what was wrong </span> and he pulled his hands off his mouth to reveal blood pouring from his upper gum. I was <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze5"> confounded for a second </span>, and I <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze6"> asked him if he had stabbed himself with a fork by accident </span>.... I <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze7"> grabbed his fork </span> and <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze8"> poked at the eggs – only to feel something crunching </span>.... After a furious conversation with the manager, he offered to take the eggs off our bill and give us a 10 % discount – not nearly enough, in my <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze9"> opinion </span> ! Luckily my <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze10"> father </span> didn't suffer any lasting injury and thus didn't want to take the incident further, but I still can't <span class="cloze document047 chain0 cloze11"> understand why they would serve the eggs like that </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document047 chain1"><p>... The only mildly disturbing thing we had heard thus far was <span class="cloze document047 chain1 cloze0"> someone </span> breaking what sounded like a glass in the kitchen, but we figured – oh, people break glasses all the time.

<div class="chain document047 chain2"><p>... Luckily my father didn't suffer any lasting injury and thus didn't want to take the incident further, but I still can't understand why they would <span class="cloze document047 chain2 cloze0"> serve the eggs like that </span>.

<div class="chain document049 chain0"><p> My <span class="cloze document049 chain0 cloze0"> wife </span> and I <span class="cloze document049 chain0 cloze1"> visit a neighborhood mom and pop restaurant about once a month </span>....

My <span class="cloze document049 chain0 cloze4"> wife </span> and I were <span class="cloze document049 chain0 cloze5"> astonished </span> ; we just looked at each other. My <span class="cloze document049 chain0 cloze6"> god </span> if she would do that in a public dining room, what does she do in the kitchen?

Their <span class="cloze document049 chain1 cloze3"> pizza </span> is served in an oblong pan with a thin crispy crust and great sauce.... My wife and I were <span class="cloze document049 chain1 cloze4"> astonished </span> </span> ; we just looked at each other.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document049 chain2"><p> My wife and I <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze0"> visit a neighborhood mom and pop restaurant about once a month </span>.... We <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze1"> told her how much we liked her <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze2"> food </span> </span>. Since then she's <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze3"> come out to say hello and ask us about the food </span> and we exchange chit-chat.... As we were exchanging pleasantries she <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze4"> turned her <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze5"> head </span> to the side </span>, <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze6"> put her <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze7"> index finger </span> over her <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze8"> left nostril </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze9"> blew her <span class="cloze document049 chain2 cloze10"> nose </span> onto the floor </span>.

<div class="chain document049 chain3"><p>... We ’ve been <span class="cloze document049 chain3 cloze0"> going there for years </span>.... About 5 or 6 years ago the owner/cook came out to our <span class="cloze document049 chain3 cloze1"> table </span> and <span class="cloze document049 chain3 cloze2"> thanked us for our <span class="cloze document049 chain3 cloze3"> patronage </span> </span>.

About two weeks ago as we were <span class="cloze document049 chain3 cloze9"> finishing dinner </span> the owner/cook stopped by. As we were <span class="cloze document049 chain3 cloze10"> exchanging pleasantries </span> she turned her head to the side, put her index finger over her left nostril and blew her nose onto the floor.... My wife and I were astonished ; we just <span class="cloze document049 chain3 cloze11"> looked at each other </span>.... As we <span class="cloze document049 chain3 cloze12"> walked out </span> I said to my wife, "Well we won't <span class="cloze document049 chain3 cloze13"> come back here for a while </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document050 chain0"><p>... For a variety of reasons, our appetites are <span class="cloze document050 chain0 cloze0"> not what they <span class="cloze document050 chain0 cloze1"> used to be </span> </span> and we don't drink alcoholic beverages.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document050 chain1"><p>... Usually this isn't a problem ; the wait staff have generally been <span class="cloze document050 chain1 cloze0"> polite throughout the meal </span> and <span class="cloze document050 chain1 cloze1"> pleasantly surprised with their <span class="cloze document050 chain1 cloze2"> gratuity </span> </span>.... A lot of the staff had been released for the evening and there was no one there we recognized immediately.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document050 chain2"><p> My wife and I are <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze0"> retired </span> </span>. We are <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze1"> active </span> and <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze2"> financially secure </span>, and <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze3"> enjoy dining out three to five times a month </span>. For a variety of reasons, our <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze4"> appetites </span> are not what they used to be and we don't <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze5"> drink alcoholic beverages </span>. Normally we <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze6"> split an entrĂŠe and an appetizer </span>, and <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze7"> have iced tea or water </span>.... We <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze8"> know to tip on what the bill would have been for two people eating "normal" meals with the result that our <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze9"> tips </span> are in the 30-50 % range of the actual meal charge </span>.... However … Recently we <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze10"> went to a familiar restaurant on a slow night </span>. A lot of the staff had been released for the evening and there was no one there we <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze11"> recognized immediately </span>. Our <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze12"> waiter </span> was new and started off being courteous and attentive. When we <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze13"> let him know we were <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze14"> going to split one meal between us </span> </span>, though, his attitude changed noticeably. His visits to our <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze15"> table </span> became perfunctory and infrequent. The entrĂŠe we <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze16"> ordered </span>, one of our favorites, usually takes 15-20 minutes to come out, but that night it took 35.... And he never came back to see how the meal was or to refill our <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze17"> waters </span>. We were <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze18"> prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to a person having a bad night, lowering our <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze19"> tip </span> to 30 % </span>. But at the end, when he dropped off the bill we both <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze20"> heard him mutter under his breath </span>, "Cheap old <bleeps> should stay home." At that point we <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze21"> called the manager over </span>. After describing what had happened and relating our <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze22"> usual habits </span> at his restaurant, he offered to comp our <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze23"> meal </span>.... We haven't <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze24"> been back to see if the waiter is still on staff </span>. I wonder, however, what we could have <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze25"> done differently to avoid his attitude </span>. Announcing at the start of the meal "Don't worry, we ’ll <span class="cloze document050 chain2 cloze26"> take care of you </span>" is well-known code for "You ’re going to be stiffed."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document050 chain3"><p>... The entrĂŠe we ordered, one of our favorites, usually takes 15-20 minutes to come out, but that night it <span class="cloze document050 chain3 cloze0"> took 35 </span>. The dish was <span class="cloze document050 chain3 cloze1"> not hot </span> and <span class="cloze document050 chain3 cloze2"> barely palatable </span> ; I believe he deliberately left it <span class="cloze document050 chain3 cloze3"> sitting before he <span class="cloze document050 chain3 cloze4"> brought it out </span> </span> as there were not enough other customers for the kitchen to be backed up.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document051 chain0"><p>... This was during <span class="cloze document051 chain0 cloze0"> the opening weekend </span> for The Dark Knight in 2008. It was <span class="cloze document051 chain0 cloze1"> a long day </span> and we had over 4,000 people come in just for that movie during my 8 hour shift.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document051 chain1"><p>... I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze0"> think this will be a little different from the stories </span> I ’ve <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze1"> read on here since this experience comes from a movie theater where I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze2"> worked in a concession stand for a year and a half </span> </span>. It was aÂ major movie theater in my <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze3"> area </span> that's since gone out of business but that's another story. I was <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze4"> working in the concession stand one day </span>.... It was a long day and we had over 4,000 people come in just for that movie during my <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze5"> 8 hour shift </span>. In the middle of my <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze6"> shift </span> I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze7"> had this lady come up to my <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze8"> register </span> </span>. I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze9"> asked her how I could <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze10"> help her today </span> </span>.... So I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze11"> went </span> and <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze12"> got her </span> the large popcorn, topped it with butter half-way like she asked, and the large bottled water. I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze13"> rang her up </span>, <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze14"> took her cash </span>, and <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze15"> gave her the change </span>. Right after that she <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze16"> asked me if we had any smaller bottles of water </span>. I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze17"> replied that yes we do as we have them in mini fridges behind the counter </span>. She <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze18"> asked me if she could have one of those instead because they were 50 cents cheaper </span>. I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze19"> told her that I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze20"> apologize </span> </span>, but I can not <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze21"> void out </span> and <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze22"> refund a transaction myself as a manager has to come down </span> and <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze23"> do that themself as per company policy </span>. So I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze24"> called on the radio for my <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze25"> manager </span> </span> and she came down and proceeded to void out the transaction. This woman then began to speak very rudely to me and my <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze26"> manager </span> saying that we needed to be put back into customer service training for "hiding" the cheaper bottles of water. She <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze27"> berated me for following such a procedure saying I was <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze28"> an idiot </span> and <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze29"> the like </span> </span>.... Thankfully the manager that came down was really cool and <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze30"> told me not to worry because the lady was just talking sh*t </span>. Â This was the only time I ’ve ever <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze31"> seen someone get that mad over 50 cents </span>. I <span class="cloze document051 chain1 cloze32"> mean really </span>?... </p></div>

<div class="chain document051 chain2"><p>... She <span class="cloze document051 chain2 cloze0"> ordered a large popcorn and a large bottle of water </span>. Makes sense as that large popcorn is going to make you thirsty, especially during a long movie. So I <span class="cloze document051 chain2 cloze1"> went </span> and got her the large popcorn, <span class="cloze document051 chain2 cloze2"> topped it with butter half-way like she asked </span>, and the large bottled water.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document051 chain3"><p>... I told her that I apologize, but I can not void out and refund a transaction myself as a manager <span class="cloze document051 chain3 cloze0"> has to come down </span> and do that themself as per company policy.

<div class="chain document051 chain7"><p>... I replied that yes we do as we <span class="cloze document051 chain7 cloze0"> have them in mini fridges behind the counter </span>.

<div class="chain document053 chain0"><p>... We decided to head to a favorite higher-end local restaurant that recently changed owners.... Seeing as the price of the dish was $ 36, I figured that the restaurant would <span class="cloze document053 chain0 cloze0"> charge me about $ 12 - $ 15 for a plain, child-sized portion of steak </span>. (This restaurant <span class="cloze document053 chain0 cloze1"> had no children's menu </span>.)... </p></div>

<div class="chain document053 chain1"><p>... Our waitress quickly <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze0"> came over </span> and we ordered our drinks, which were served promptly.... One of my daughters is very picky about what she <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze1"> eats while the other would eat the table if she <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze2"> could </span> </span>. My picky daughter really <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze3"> wanted steak without sides or any sort of sauce </span>.... We <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze4"> asked the waitress about this </span> and she <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze5"> said that she "would <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze6"> check on it </span> </span>." Within a few minutes, our waitress <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze7"> came back with bad news </span>, they could do us a "favor" and take only $ 6 off the original price.... Appalled, I whispered to the waitress that that was ridiculous and we could figure it out on our own. She <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze8"> called the manager over </span>.... My daughter who eats everything and didn't really want steak that night became a trooper and agreed to split a steak with her <span class="cloze document053 chain1 cloze9"> sister </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document053 chain2"><p>... We <span class="cloze document053 chain2 cloze0"> decided to head to a favorite higher-end local restaurant that recently changed owners </span>....

He <span class="cloze document053 chain2 cloze3"> seated us in a booth near the back, which I didn't mind </span>.

Since it was my <span class="cloze document053 chain3 cloze8"> husband's </span> birthday, I didn't <span class="cloze document053 chain3 cloze9"> want to create a ruckus </span> and <span class="cloze document053 chain3 cloze10"> told him that everything was fine </span>. My <span class="cloze document053 chain3 cloze11"> daughter </span> who eats everything and didn't really want steak that night became a trooper and agreed to split a steak with her sister.... The whole ambiance was ruined because of my <span class="cloze document053 chain3 cloze12"> first impression </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document053 chain4"><p> My husband, mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, two daughters and I were <span class="cloze document053 chain4 cloze0"> going out to dinner for my husband's <span class="cloze document053 chain4 cloze1"> birthday </span> </span>....

<div class="chain document054 chain0"><p> A few years ago, I was <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze0"> working at a local restaurant that featured breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets </span>. I always <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze1"> worked the breakfast and lunch buffets </span> ; we turned tables very quickly so even bad tips could be forgiven due to getting so many of them.... "Jerry" was <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze2"> a regular </span> and <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze3"> came in on the same two days every week to sit in the same smoking booth right next to the kitchen </span>.... After a few months of employment, I was finally <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze4"> assigned to the smoking section when "Jerry" <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze5"> came in </span> </span>.... He left me <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze6"> a $ 5 </span> on the table off a bill that was barely over $ 6 and I was <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze7"> quite happy </span>.... As I was <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze8"> exiting the kitchen after his table was cleaned and reset </span>, "Jerry" <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze9"> reappeared </span> and <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze10"> gestured for me to hold out my <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze11"> hand </span> </span>. I <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze12"> did so </span>, and he slipped me <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze13"> a $ 100 bill </span> and a note. He quickly left as I <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze14"> unfolded the note </span>. It said "Take a smoke break and <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze15"> meet me out back </span>." I <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze16"> froze </span>, then began frantically looking around to find a coworker and ask them what was going on. The story I <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze17"> got </span> was that "Jerry" would <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze18"> offer a large tip if you met him out back for a little you-know-what </span>. I was <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze19"> mortified </span> ! I <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze20"> gave the $ 100 and the note to my <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze21"> manager </span> (a middle aged, outspoken woman) </span> and <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze22"> told her to please get this back to him </span>, and <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze23"> went back to my <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze24"> section </span> </span>. She was as shocked as I and promptly kicked him off the property with a threat to call the police. I <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze25"> learned later that "Jerry" had been <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze26"> doing this for years </span> </span> and not a soul had thought to speak up about it.... My <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze27"> coworker </span> who had earned her $ 100 about a week earlier was fired after the truth came out and "Jerry" <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze28"> eventually stopped coming back </span>. It pains me to <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze29"> think that "Jerry" had been <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze30"> able to take advantage of females by offering them cash they </span> </span> were desperate for, and it bothers me <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze31"> even more </span> that these girls either accepted his offer or were too afraid to speak up.... – Jamie Baker My <span class="cloze document054 chain0 cloze32"> blog </span> : The Sanity of a Mad Woman </p></div>

<div class="chain document054 chain1"><p>... I did so, and he slipped me a $ 100 bill and a note. He quickly left as I <span class="cloze document054 chain1 cloze0"> unfolded the note </span>.

<div class="chain document054 chain5"><p>... Servers rarely forget a bad tipper, or a good one, but one man <span class="cloze document054 chain5 cloze0"> stood out from all the rest </span>....

<div class="chain document056 chain0"><p> About two months ago, my grandmother, mother, sister, and I <span class="cloze document056 chain0 cloze0"> decided to eat at a chain restaurant in Cape Cod </span>.... My grandmother <span class="cloze document056 chain0 cloze1"> ordered a tea with milk and lemon on the side </span> and Alley just took a cup of cold water, shoved the lemon and tea bag in it, and gave her cream instead of milk.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document056 chain1"><p>... The hostess was <span class="cloze document056 chain1 cloze0"> very nice </span>, but the waitress was <span class="cloze document056 chain1 cloze1"> the problem </span>. First of all, her <span class="cloze document056 chain1 cloze2"> name </span> was "Alley" as in a back alley in the city.... My grandmother ordered a tea with milk and lemon on the side and Alley just took a cup of cold water, shoved the lemon and tea bag in it, and gave her <span class="cloze document056 chain1 cloze3"> cream </span> instead of milk. Was she joking? Then, she didn't ever <span class="cloze document056 chain1 cloze4"> serve the food herself </span> </span>. Finally, when my sister <span class="cloze document056 chain1 cloze5"> ordered a brownie sundae </span>, she <span class="cloze document056 chain1 cloze6"> gave her a regular one </span>. We left her <span class="cloze document056 chain1 cloze7"> a minimal tip </span> and on the way out whispered, "You need some training, honey." </p></div>

<div class="chain document056 chain2"><p>...

<div class="chain document057 chain0"><p>... Immediately after being seated in a booth, I <span class="cloze document057 chain0 cloze0"> put my purse beside me </span> and all of a sudden a full glass of water and ice came tumbling down from a ledge on the back of the booth falling smack dab into my purse, drenching my cell phone and everything else in it. I was left to empty all items in my purse onto the table and pour out the excess water and ice !... Luckily, my cell phone still works and my purse and the items in it <span class="cloze document057 chain0 cloze1"> dried out overnight </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document057 chain1"><p>...

<div class="chain document058 chain1"><p>...

<div class="chain document058 chain2"><p> I am not <span class="cloze document058 chain2 cloze0"> shy to say this is regarding the Bob's B ** B ** restaurant in El Cajon, California.Â This place was an epic disappointment !! </span>...

<div class="chain document059 chain0"><p> A few years back I stopped into a Mexican place for lunch with a friend – my treat. I had just graduated from college and was on a somewhat tight budget and <span class="cloze document059 chain0 cloze0"> asked my friend to <span class="cloze document059 chain0 cloze1"> constrain himself to the lunch menu </span> </span>....

My friend and I had never <span class="cloze document059 chain0 cloze4"> ordered that meal before </span> and <span class="cloze document059 chain0 cloze5"> had no idea </span> the size difference between a lunch and dinner portion, and I had definitely made my lunch preference clear.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document059 chain1"><p>... I <span class="cloze document059 chain1 cloze0"> ordered a chicken tortilla dish that I couldn't quite pronounce </span>.

<div class="chain document059 chain2"><p>... I <span class="cloze document059 chain2 cloze0"> tracked down the waiter </span> and explained that our lunch meal should have been $ 6.95, not $ 11.95 each.

I <span class="cloze document059 chain2 cloze2"> told him that I had not ordered the dinner portion, and in fact had pointed to the lunch menu, during lunch hours </span>. He <span class="cloze document059 chain2 cloze3"> replied with "Well, you ate a dinner portion </span>."... I was a server for 4 years in college, and that's the first and only time I have ever <span class="cloze document059 chain2 cloze4"> stiffed my waiter </span> or paid less than the bill (and I don't feel a single regret about it). </p></div>

<div class="chain document059 chain3"><p>... After about 15 minutes of getting our <span class="cloze document059 chain3 cloze0"> drinks </span>, my friend and I proceeded to order....

I tracked down the waiter and explained that our <span class="cloze document059 chain3 cloze2"> lunch meal </span> should have been $ 6.95, not $ 11.95 each.... I put down $ 2 less than what our <span class="cloze document059 chain3 cloze3"> meal </span> SHOULD have cost and walked out, all while they threatened to call the police.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document059 chain4"><p>... Then the bill <span class="cloze document059 chain4 cloze0"> comes </span> and I notice it's for <span class="cloze document059 chain4 cloze1"> a full </span> $ 10 more than I anticipated.... I asked to see a manager, and when the manager came they said I would have to <span class="cloze document059 chain4 cloze2"> pay the full bill </span>....

I <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze15"> tracked down the waiter </span> and <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze16"> explained that our lunch meal should have been $ 6.95, not $ 11.95 each </span>. He said "You both <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze17"> got the dinner </span>." I <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze18"> told him that I had not <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze19"> ordered the dinner portion </span>, and in fact had <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze20"> pointed to the lunch menu, during lunch hours </span> </span>. He replied with "Well, you <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze21"> ate a dinner portion </span>." My <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze22"> friend </span> and I had never <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze23"> ordered that meal before </span> and had no idea the size difference between a lunch and dinner portion, and I had definitely <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze24"> made my <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze25"> lunch preference </span> clear </span>. I <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze26"> asked to see a manager, and when the manager came they said I would <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze27"> have to pay the full bill </span> </span>. I was <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze28"> livid </span> at this point and <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze29"> told him that I would <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze30"> pay for what I had <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze31"> ordered, not for their mistake </span> </span> </span>.... Then both the manager and server proceeded to yell at me at the register. I <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze32"> put down $ 2 less than what our meal SHOULD have cost and walked out, all while they threatened to call the police </span>. I was <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze33"> a server </span> for 4 years in college, and that's the first and only time I have ever <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze34"> stiffed my <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze35"> waiter </span> </span> or <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze36"> paid less than the bill (and I don't <span class="cloze document059 chain5 cloze37"> feel a single regret about it </span>) </span>. </p></div>

<div class="chain document059 chain6"><p>... After about 15 minutes of getting our drinks, my friend and I <span class="cloze document059 chain6 cloze0"> proceeded to order </span> </span>....

<div class="chain document059 chain7"><p>... It was <span class="cloze document059 chain7 cloze0"> only $ 10 </span>, but it was <span class="cloze document059 chain7 cloze1"> the principle </span> of the matter.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document059 chain8"><p>... I asked to <span class="cloze document059 chain8 cloze0"> see a manager </span>, and when the manager <span class="cloze document059 chain8 cloze1"> came they <span class="cloze document059 chain8 cloze2"> said I would have to pay the full bill </span> </span>.

<div class="chain document062 chain0"><p>... A four top in a corner booth ; mother, father and two 7 to 10 year old kids. I <span class="cloze document062 chain0 cloze0"> approach them with a tray with four full water glasses </span>.... His wife and the kids <span class="cloze document062 chain0 cloze1"> joined in </span> and they assured me (while I am profusely apologizing and grabbing extra napkins from the empty tables near them) not to worry, and that it would be a great story to tell when they got home from their vacation.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document062 chain1"><p>... The family valiantly <span class="cloze document062 chain1 cloze0"> tried to exit the booth before the waterfall hit the edge of the table, but because it was a corner round booth they never <span class="cloze document062 chain1 cloze1"> had a chance </span> </span>. They all got <span class="cloze document062 chain1 cloze2"> drenched </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document062 chain2"><p>... When I went to a table with a dirty ashtray I would use a clean ashtray to <span class="cloze document062 chain2 cloze0"> cover the dirty one </span>, bring both back to my tray and then place the clean one back where the dirty one <span class="cloze document062 chain2 cloze1"> was </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document062 chain3"><p>... I was having some trouble with an eight top round table. The chairs were fairly tight (I think it may have been a six top with two extra chairs squeezed in) and the dirty ashtray I was after was near the center of the table.... The table was <span class="cloze document062 chain3 cloze0"> furious </span> and being new to my first job I was pretty sure I was going to be fired. The manager sent me to the back and I think wound up <span class="cloze document062 chain3 cloze1"> comping the table at the very least </span>, but I am pretty sure their dining experience had been ruined for the evening. The manager assured me that I was not fired and had me practice using the tray in the back until the table <span class="cloze document062 chain3 cloze2"> left the restaurant </span>.... I donâ   t know if I was moving too fast, had the tray at an angle or both, but when I stopped at the table the four glasses of water kept going and all fell over onto the table. The family valiantly tried to exit the booth before the waterfall hit the edge of the table, but because it was a corner round booth they never had a chance.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document062 chain4"><p>... She <span class="cloze document062 chain4 cloze0"> jumped up </span>, I apologized profusely, her <span class="cloze document062 chain4 cloze1"> husband/boyfriend </span> jumped in my face (I think he was really close to decking me).... </p></div>

<div class="chain document062 chain5"><p> This is a story of one dinner that I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze0"> ruined </span> and one that could have been ruined by … me. My <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze1"> first job </span> was a busboy/food runner at a fairly upscale restaurant (linen tablecloths, complimentary sorbet between course). Incident # 1 (dinner ruined) : I was <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze2"> going around changing ashtrays at the tables </span>. I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze3"> had a tray of clean and dirty ashtrays in one hand </span>. When I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze4"> went to a table with a dirty ashtray </span> I would <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze5"> use a clean ashtray to cover the dirty one </span>, bring both back to my <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze6"> tray </span> and then place the clean one back where the dirty one was.

I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze10"> leaned </span>, I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze11"> stretched </span>. Just as I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze12"> got the ashtray one of the full dirty ashtrays slides off of the tray in my <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze13"> handâ </span>  Ś right down the low cut back of the dress of one of the customers </span> ! She jumped up, I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze14"> apologized profusely, her husband/boyfriend jumped in my <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze15"> face </span> (I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze16"> think he was really close to <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze17"> decking me </span> </span>) </span>. The table was furious and being new to my <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze18"> first job </span> I was <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze19"> pretty sure I was <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze20"> going to be fired </span> </span>.

Incident # 2 (dinner could have been ruined) : Still the same job and still fairly new, I am <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze27"> happy to say that in my <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze28"> whole career </span> following this was the second and last time I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze29"> lost a tray </span> </span> (or something from the tray).... I <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze30"> approach them with a tray with four full water glasses </span>.

I was <span class="cloze document062 chain5 cloze32"> expecting the worst when all of a sudden the father burst out laughing </span>.

<div class="chain document065 chain0"><p>...

<div class="chain document065 chain3"><p>... Unfortunately, it <span class="cloze document065 chain3 cloze0"> did not </span>.

Being fair and patient people, we tried the restaurant just once more – and while it was still very loud, with nearly everyone yelling conversationally, and the chicken still <span class="cloze document065 chain3 cloze3"> had the appeal of a dirty sock </span> – at least the lazy-looking bunch wasn't still crowding two tables at the door.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document065 chain6"><p> After a long day out of town (our <span class="cloze document065 chain6 cloze0"> town </span> is very small so most of our <span class="cloze document065 chain6 cloze1"> shopping </span> has to be done hours away), it's nice to come home with a meal someone else cooked and in containers you won't have to wash – and that was the exact reason we <span class="cloze document065 chain6 cloze2"> had </span> for stopping at a famous fried chicken place.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document069 chain1"><p>... After we placed our orders Aaron then <span class="cloze document069 chain1 cloze0"> extended his hand out to me to shake </span>.

<div class="chain document069 chain2"><p>...

<div class="chain document074 chain5"><p> Two friends and I <span class="cloze document074 chain5 cloze0"> went to "Pepper's" one day right before the dinner rush. </span> </span> We were <span class="cloze document074 chain5 cloze1"> seated in a booth </span> and one of my friends had the misfortune of being back-to-back to a girl (about age 6) who was practically bouncing off the walls of the booth she shared with her mother, who was basically ignoring what she was doing.... The potted plant stayed where it was until we had just <span class="cloze document074 chain5 cloze2"> ordered our <span class="cloze document074 chain5 cloze3"> drinks </span> </span>.... We <span class="cloze document074 chain5 cloze4"> ended up moving tables </span> and the mother and daughter ended up leaving shortly thereafter, seemingly totally oblivious to people in our <span class="cloze document074 chain5 cloze5"> area </span> of the restaurant glaring at them. </p></div>

<div class="chain document074 chain6"><p>... We ended up moving tables and the mother and daughter <span class="cloze document074 chain6 cloze0"> ended up leaving shortly thereafter </span> </span>, seemingly totally oblivious to people in our area of the restaurant glaring at them. </p></div>

<div class="chain document075 chain0"><p>... She did the work and I felt she <span class="cloze document075 chain0 cloze0"> earned the tip </span>. I glanced at the six $ 1 bills I had intended to leave as the rest of his tip (I like to get my change back prior to leaving a tip in most cases ; if the server says "I ’ll be right back with your change" I always <span class="cloze document075 chain0 cloze1"> increase the tip because I think it's the better response over "do you need change?" </span>)... </p></div>

<div class="chain document075 chain1"><p>... Their <span class="cloze document075 chain1 cloze0"> meat </span> comes from local farmers and is top quality, their <span class="cloze document075 chain1 cloze1"> veggies </span> are locally grown when available, and their <span class="cloze document075 chain1 cloze2"> chefs </span> work magic in their <span class="cloze document075 chain1 cloze3"> kitchen </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document075 chain2"><p>... We let her know the entrees had yet to be ordered, so she <span class="cloze document075 chain2 cloze0"> took our order </span> and told us she ’d get them in.... I didn't <span class="cloze document075 chain2 cloze1"> take your order </span>." I said, "The bartender came back after our drinks and said she ’d let you <span class="cloze document075 chain2 cloze2"> know the order so you could <span class="cloze document075 chain2 cloze3"> put it in </span> </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document075 chain3"><p>... I said, "The bartender came back after our drinks and said she ’d let you <span class="cloze document075 chain3 cloze0"> know the order so you could <span class="cloze document075 chain3 cloze1"> put it in </span> </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document075 chain4"><p>... We let her <span class="cloze document075 chain4 cloze0"> know that this was a first for us </span> and we love the restaurant. She grabbed us </span> to-go waters and when she <span class="cloze document075 chain4 cloze1"> returned </span>, I handed her a $ 10 bill, <span class="cloze document075 chain4 cloze2"> thanking her for helping us </span>. She <span class="cloze document075 chain4 cloze3"> did the work </span> and I felt she <span class="cloze document075 chain4 cloze4"> earned the tip </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document075 chain5"><p>... My husband and I <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze0"> go whenever we <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze1"> have an excuse to drive into the city </span> </span> </span>. Unfortunately, our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze2"> last visit </span> did not meet the high standards we had <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze3"> become used to </span>. As we <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze4"> scanned over our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze5"> menus </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze6"> talked about the movie we were <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze7"> seeing afterward </span> </span>, I kept my eye open for our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze8"> server </span> as the minutes ticked by. As I was about to ask the hostess if she could <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze9"> assist us in finding our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze10"> server </span> </span>, the bartender came by and asked if we had been <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze11"> helped </span>. I replied in the negative and, with a smile, she offered to track our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze12"> server </span> down.... The bartender introduced our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze13"> server </span>, laid down coasters, and bid us <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze14"> farewell </span> with a smile and a small wave. Our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze15"> server </span> then said, "So, what are you getting?" Ignoring the strong smell of cigarettes, we both <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze16"> went to order </span>. My husband requested beers for us, to which the server replied, "Is that all?"... Our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze17"> server </span> sighed and left the table without a word. A couple of minutes passed before the lovely bartender brought our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze18"> beers </span>, and upon noticing we still <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze19"> had our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze20"> menus </span> </span>, asked if we had <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze21"> ordered </span>.

She brought us <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze25"> our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze26"> waters </span> </span>, the appetizer, and eventually our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze27"> entrees </span>. We were not <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze28"> seated in the bar area </span>, but she went out of her way to <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze29"> help us anyway </span>, which I thought was fantastic.

I said, "The bartender came back after our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze33"> drinks </span> and said she ’d let you know the order so you could put it in."... As we <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze34"> finished </span>, the bartender came back to bus our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze35"> table and talk </span> to us for a few minutes about the movie we were <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze36"> going to see later </span>. As we <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze37"> spoke </span>, our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze38"> server </span> popped up and slapped the bill on the table, asking "you ready?"... The bartender gave us a sympathetic look and apologized for his attitude. We <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze39"> let her know that this was a first for us </span> and we <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze40"> love the restaurant </span>. She grabbed us to-go waters and when she returned, I handed her a $ 10 bill, thanking her for <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze41"> helping us </span>.... Unfortunately, due to his careless attitude, his lack of service, and being made to feel as though we were <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze42"> annoying him by being seated in his section </span>, I decided not to leave a tip. People like that server cast a black cloud over amazing restaurants, but thankfully they are outnumbered by fantastic people like our <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze43"> bartender </span>. We <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze44"> will of course return </span>, as it's a favorite spot for us, and we <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze45"> hope that when we <span class="cloze document075 chain5 cloze46"> do </span>, that server is nowhere in sight </span>.... </p></div>

As we finished, the bartender <span class="cloze document075 chain7 cloze5"> came back to bus our table and talk to us for a few minutes about the movie we were going to see later </span>.... I gave him cash ($ 40 on a $ 38 bill) and he <span class="cloze document075 chain7 cloze6"> vanished again without a word </span>. As he <span class="cloze document075 chain7 cloze7"> entered the kitchen </span>, I heard a voice I assumed was his say "cheap f-ing a-holes."

<div class="chain document080 chain6"><p>... She went back and yelled and yelled for the cook.

<div class="chain document086 chain0"><p> About two years ago I was <span class="cloze document086 chain0 cloze0"> dining at an Asian restaurant in San Antonio with my <span class="cloze document086 chain0 cloze1"> mother </span> and younger brother </span>. The food was delicious but a few things <span class="cloze document086 chain0 cloze2"> bothered me </span>.... The waitress offered to refill my <span class="cloze document086 chain0 cloze3"> mother </span> and brother's glasses, but she never asked if I <span class="cloze document086 chain0 cloze4"> needed one </span>. I always <span class="cloze document086 chain0 cloze5"> had to speak up and try to get her attention for a refill </span>. This definitely wasn't a super terrible experience, but it did leave me <span class="cloze document086 chain0 cloze6"> feeling slightly odd afterwards </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document086 chain1"><p>... That was <span class="cloze document086 chain1 cloze0"> nice </span> when it <span class="cloze document086 chain1 cloze1"> came to requesting refills </span>, but <span class="cloze document086 chain1 cloze2"> then there comes the second oddity </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document086 chain2"><p>... First, the waitress stood right by our <span class="cloze document086 chain2 cloze0"> table </span> the entire time and never left our <span class="cloze document086 chain2 cloze1"> side </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document086 chain3"><p>...

<div class="chain document086 chain4"><p>... This definitely wasn't <span class="cloze document086 chain4 cloze0"> a super terrible experience </span>, but it did <span class="cloze document086 chain4 cloze1"> leave me feeling slightly odd afterwards </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document091 chain0"><p>... About 10 minutes after the table (not mine) <span class="cloze document091 chain0 cloze0"> received the lemonades </span>, the children began acting extremely hyper. One of the parents <span class="cloze document091 chain0 cloze1"> tasted the lemonade </span> and was shocked by the strong taste of alcohol.Â Turned out that poor "Lacy" had accidentally <span class="cloze document091 chain0 cloze2"> grabbed the pre-made Long Island mix rather than the lemonade </span> ; none were labeled and the color difference was very subtle.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document091 chain1"><p>... The parents were <span class="cloze document091 chain1 cloze0"> absolutely livid </span> !... They understandably began to yell at "Lacy" for poisoning their children and she began to cry and ran to the back of the house while management came up to <span class="cloze document091 chain1 cloze1"> assist the livid parents </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document091 chain2"><p>... One day, my friend "Lacy" was tending bar and was preparing an order of strawberry lemonades for a table with a couple of children. About 10 minutes after the table (not mine) received the lemonades, the children <span class="cloze document091 chain2 cloze0"> began acting extremely hyper </span>.... Both children (one was around 5, the other around 8 years old) had <span class="cloze document091 chain2 cloze1"> consumed about half of their drinks, approximately 4 ounces of our very strong house Long Island </span>. They understandably <span class="cloze document091 chain2 cloze2"> began to <span class="cloze document091 chain2 cloze3"> yell at "Lacy" for poisoning their <span class="cloze document091 chain2 cloze4"> children </span> </span> </span> and she began to cry and ran to the back of the house while management came up to assist the livid parents. One free meal (for a later date), a promise from the corporate office to pay for a doctor visit, and a lot of apologies later, the group calmed down and decided not to call the police as they previously <span class="cloze document091 chain2 cloze5"> intended </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document091 chain3"><p>...

<div class="chain document091 chain4"><p>... Both children (one was around 5, the other around 8 years old) had consumed about half of their drinks, approximately 4 ounces of our <span class="cloze document091 chain4 cloze0"> very strong house </span> Long Island....

<div class="chain document091 chain5"><p> The last job I <span class="cloze document091 chain5 cloze0"> held waiting tables </span> was at a neighborhood restaurant chain that catered to families and tried to liven up their bar area at night for the adult crowd. I <span class="cloze document091 chain5 cloze1"> tended bar at least one night a week </span> and <span class="cloze document091 chain5 cloze2"> waited tables </span> or expedited the rest of the time.

<div class="chain document092 chain0"><p>... No 16-year-old girl needs to <span class="cloze document092 chain0 cloze0"> see an over 40-year-old ding-a-ling </span> and I <span class="cloze document092 chain0 cloze1"> high-tailed it out of there </span> !... </p></div>

<div class="chain document092 chain1"><p>... Each location was independently owned and our owner, Mr. "Matt," <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze0"> seemed to be a fairly good boss </span>. Granted, he was way <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze1"> too enthused </span> about giving me a <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze2"> 15 cent raise, but all in all he treated employees well.Â One night, I was mopping the bathrooms after the dining area had closed, doing women's </span> first and then cleaning up in the men's. Mr. "Matt" <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze3"> opened the swinging door </span> and I assumed he was <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze4"> checking in on me </span>, so I let him <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze5"> know that I was nearly done </span>. He <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze6"> proceeded to unzip his <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze7"> pants </span> and use the urinal in full view of me </span>.... I was later told by a shift manager that Mr. "Matt" is just <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze8"> a comfortable person </span> and isn't shy or reserved. This became apparent later on in his <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze9"> interactions </span> with customers ; I witnessed him <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze10"> spank a 20-something female on her rear, ogle teenager girls who were dressed as though they just came from track practice (short shorts) </span>, and <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze11"> make lewd comments at cheerleaders </span>. The problem was, he was <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze12"> so beloved in the adult community </span> that the complaints from us "children" didn't go far and nothing was ever done.... It's a shame, especially based on the company values (they are very wholesome), and I do hope that at this point Mr. "Matt" has been <span class="cloze document092 chain1 cloze13"> terminated </span>.... </p></div>

This became apparent later on in his interactions with customers ; I <span class="cloze document092 chain3 cloze12"> witnessed him spank a 20-something female on her rear, ogle teenager girls who were dressed as though they just came from track practice (short shorts), and make lewd comments at cheerleaders </span>....

<div class="chain document093 chain0"><p> Last summer, just around the corner from where I work, a new pizza place <span class="cloze document093 chain0 cloze0"> opened up </span>. They are <span class="cloze document093 chain0 cloze1"> a smaller, local chain </span> and I wanted to check out what they <span class="cloze document093 chain0 cloze2"> had to offer </span>.

<div class="chain document093 chain1"><p>... So, I called in my order right after work – one pineapple pizza and one pepperoni pizza. It was for carry-out and they told me the order would be <span class="cloze document093 chain1 cloze0"> ready in approximately 15 minutes </span>.... Me : (thinking this is Candid Camera) Then why did you <span class="cloze document093 chain1 cloze1"> TAKE my order??! </span>... </p></div>

<div class="chain document093 chain2"><p>... Him : We don't have them.... Him : They ’re just not here.... We ’re waiting on the repairman to get there.

<div class="chain document093 chain3"><p>... Him : (defeated) Well, our pizza oven has been <span class="cloze document093 chain3 cloze0"> broken all day </span>.... Not, "Oh – my oven is <span class="cloze document093 chain3 cloze1"> broke </span>."... </p></div>

They <span class="cloze document093 chain5 cloze1"> ’re not here </span>." The conversation continues like this : Me : They ’re … <span class="cloze document093 chain5 cloze2"> not </span>? Where <span class="cloze document093 chain5 cloze3"> are they </span>? Him : We don't <span class="cloze document093 chain5 cloze4"> have them </span>. Me : What happened to them?

<div class="chain document093 chain6"><p>... Before I lost my cool I just said, "You <span class="cloze document093 chain6 cloze0"> know what </span>? <span class="cloze document093 chain6 cloze1"> Forget it </span>."... </p></div>

We <span class="cloze document094 chain0 cloze8"> phoned up the pizza company again </span>, and they said they ’d ship another one out and also give us credit for 2 missing pizzas.

<div class="chain document095 chain0"><p>...

They <span class="cloze document095 chain0 cloze4"> got greedy though </span> – did they really <span class="cloze document095 chain0 cloze5"> think we wouldn't notice a bill for meals for 43 people when there were only 21 of us </span>? </p></div>

Service was very slow, but we were <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze2"> a big party </span> and we were in <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze3"> a function room </span> downstairs from the main restaurant, and everyone was having a good time, so I didn't worry too much about that. Some of us ordered desserts, which didn't come, although the waiting staff were very quick to bring more wine. Thinking about it now, I ’m pretty sure they were deliberately slow with the service to <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze4"> encourage us to order more wine </span>.... When I looked at the bill more closely, they had charged us </span> for 25 starters and 43 main courses, even though there were only 21 of us. We <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze5"> pointed this out to the staff </span> and they came back with a revised bill, with a lump sum knocked off the previous £ 700. We <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze6"> asked them to go away, find the order slip on which our <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze7"> original order </span> was written, and work the bill out from there </span>.... So, they wouldn't give us a correct bill, and as people had already started to leave, we couldn't <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze8"> work out properly what we <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze9"> owed </span> </span>. But we <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze10"> did know that 21 people hadn't ordered 25 starters and 43 main courses </span>.

They refused to accept it and <span class="cloze document095 chain2 cloze14"> threatened us with the police </span>, so a colleague of mine gave them another £ 60 to shut them up.... </p></div>

The total was just under £ 700, which for 2 courses for 21 people, a few deserts, and I have no idea how much wine, was an AWFUL lot of money in 2000.... When I <span class="cloze document095 chain3 cloze6"> looked at the bill more closely </span>, they had charged us for 25 starters and 43 main courses, even though there were only 21 of us....

<div class="chain document096 chain0"><p>... We saw that the only thing we could really afford on the menu for our lunch was fries and we ’d still have a bit left for the tip, so we agreed to get it and waited for the waitress to come around.Â We had been seated at a booth next to our friend's long table, and after the waitress <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze0"> took everyone else's orders she <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze1"> came over to us </span> </span> and charmingly <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze2"> introduced herself </span> and asked what we ’d like to order. When we said, "We ’ll split a basket of fries," her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze3"> whole demeanor </span> changed, she <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze4"> became very frigid and brusque </span>, <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze5"> scribbled it down </span>, and immediately <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze6"> left </span>. Everyone got their items, and about 5 minutes later she <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze7"> plunked down a basket of cold fries for us as if it was an afterthought </span>. She never <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze8"> asked us if we wanted refills on our empty water cups and we never had time to <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze9"> ask her because of her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze10"> extremely brisk and rude manner </span> </span> </span>. Our friend's table was a very busy one, but our booth almost t-boned the table and to get from one end to another (which she <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze11"> did a lot since our friends had bottomless drinks and fries </span> !) she <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze12"> had to go directly past us </span>. She was <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze13"> flirting about with the male members of our party and charming the girls </span>, refilling cups in an eye blink and swooping in at the slightest gesture from someone. The difference between her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze14"> amazing attentive treatment </span> of them and her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze15"> cold condescending treatment </span> of us was astounding. Even though she <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze16"> went past us several times </span> she wouldn't <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze17"> even glance </span> at us and <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze18"> ignored our attempts to gain her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze19"> attention </span> </span>.... Everyone finally finished eating and our waitress <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze20"> began to hand around the bills </span>. We waited expectantly for our bill, however she <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze21"> continued to sweep past us, practically giving us goosebumps from her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze22"> absolutely frigid attitude </span> </span>. My sister and I were very confused about her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze23"> attitude </span>, but we finally <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze24"> managed to flag her down as she <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze25"> bulled past us after picking up a few bills </span> </span>. We <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze26"> asked her for our bill </span> and she coldly <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze27"> replied, "Your fries are free since your friends ordered bottomless fries" </span> and <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze28"> whipped off again </span>. My sister and I were surprised ; we had no idea the fries would be free but I guess that's why she was <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze29"> so rude to us </span>. Perhaps she <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze30"> thought we came in just to mooch fries and assumed we were some sort of scum even though we were clean, well dressed </span> and <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze31"> spoke well </span>. We were disgusted by her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze32"> inability to treat even a non-paying customer with respect </span>, but we still left our entire $ 5 on the table for her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze33"> hoping it might make her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze34"> regret </span> her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze35"> actions </span> and be kinder in the future </span>. Whether or not that was good for her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze36"> character </span> I have no idea, but her <span class="cloze document096 chain0 cloze37"> service </span> sure put me off that restaurant for good. </p></div>

<div class="chain document096 chain1"><p>... This was after a weekend teen camp and my sister and I had pitched in for gas and such for the trip which <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze0"> left us with $ 5 to split </span>. We <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze1"> saw that the only thing we could really <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze2"> afford on the menu for our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze3"> lunch </span> </span> was fries and we ’d still <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze4"> have a bit left for the tip </span> </span>, so we <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze5"> agreed to get it </span> and <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze6"> waited for the waitress to come around.Â We had been <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze7"> seated at a booth next to our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze8"> friend's </span> long table </span>, and after the waitress took everyone else's orders she came over to us and charmingly introduced herself and asked what we ’d <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze9"> like to order </span> </span>. When we <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze10"> said, "We ’ll <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze11"> split a basket of fries </span> </span>," her whole demeanor changed, she became very frigid and brusque, scribbled it down, and immediately left. Everyone got their items, and about 5 minutes later she plunked down a basket of cold fries for us as if it was an afterthought. She never <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze12"> asked us if we <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze13"> wanted refills on our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze14"> empty water cups </span> </span> and we never <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze15"> had time to ask her because of her extremely brisk and rude manner </span> </span>. Our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze16"> friend's </span> table was a very busy one, but our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze17"> booth </span> almost t-boned the table and to get from one end to another (which she did a lot since our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze18"> friends </span> had bottomless drinks and fries !) she had to go directly past us. She was flirting about with the male members of our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze19"> party </span> and charming the girls, refilling cups in an eye blink and swooping in at the slightest gesture from someone. The difference between her amazing attentive treatment of them and her cold condescending treatment of us was astounding. Even though she went past us several times she wouldn't even glance at us and ignored our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze20"> attempts </span> to gain her attention. We <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze21"> never got refills for our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze22"> water or fries </span> </span> and <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze23"> ended up accepting our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze24"> friend's </span> offers to share their drinks (even they had noticed that by that point we were <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze25"> drink and foodless </span> !) </span>... Everyone finally finished eating and our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze26"> waitress </span> began to hand around the bills. We <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze27"> waited expectantly for our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze28"> bill </span> </span>, however she continued to sweep past us, practically giving us goosebumps from her absolutely frigid attitude. My sister and I were very confused about her attitude, but we finally <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze29"> managed to flag her down as she bulled past us after picking up a few bills </span>. We <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze30"> asked her for our <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze31"> bill </span> </span> and she coldly replied, "Your fries are free since your friends ordered bottomless fries" and whipped off again. My sister and I were surprised ; we <span class="cloze document096 chain1 cloze32"> had no idea the fries would be free </span> but I guess that's why she was so rude to us.

<div class="chain document097 chain1"><p>...

<div class="chain document098 chain0"><p> In October 2010, I drove 300 miles to spend the weekend with my first love from high school, 26 years later (we had recently <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze0"> reunited after not seeing each other for over 20 years </span>). I met him at the hotel and we <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze1"> left for dinner in his car </span>. We <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze2"> went to a fairly nice chain steak restaurant (think Texas) </span>.... We were <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze3"> seated immediately </span> and the server came to our <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze4"> table </span> quickly and asked if we ’d <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze5"> like something from the bar </span>.... I showed her the chardonnay so she ’d know what I wanted and she went off to get our <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze6"> drinks </span>.... Then came time to order our <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze7"> food </span> … we still didn't <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze8"> have our <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze9"> drinks </span> </span> … I ordered one of their salads.... We were not <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze10"> making out </span> or anything and it was brief, but a nice kiss (the restaurant was nearly empty and no one around our <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze11"> area </span>). I opened my eyes to see her just standing at our <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze12"> table </span>, basically <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze13"> watching us, with his beer in her hand </span> … smiling.... You would think she would have just sat down the beer, or took a walk around to give us a second or at least cleared her throat or something … not just watch until we were <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze14"> done </span> ! She never checked back to see how the food was or if we <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze15"> needed another drink (a runner brought the food) </span>. We <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze16"> saw her hanging out near the bar the whole time, chatting </span>. We <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze17"> finally flagged her down to get another beer for my fiance </span>. She never asked about our <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze18"> meals </span> and arrived with his beer nearly 15 minutes later ! We <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze19"> asked for the check </span> and he quickly finished his beer. Fortunately our <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze20"> mood </span> really could not be ruined and we just <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze21"> laughed it off as her probably being new </span>.... We are getting <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze22"> married next month </span> and seriously <span class="cloze document098 chain0 cloze23"> considering eating dinner there that evening just for old time's sake </span>.

<div class="chain document098 chain3"><p>... I said, "It's <span class="cloze document098 chain3 cloze0"> wine </span>." She said, "I ’ve never heard of it so I don't think we <span class="cloze document098 chain3 cloze1"> have it </span>."... </p></div>

<div class="chain document098 chain4"><p>... She never asked about our meals and arrived with his <span class="cloze document098 chain4 cloze0"> beer </span> nearly 15 minutes later !

<div class="chain document098 chain6"><p>... My (now) fiance ordered a commonly known beer and I <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze0"> asked if they had a riesling </span>....

Anyway, I again <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze2"> told her it was wine </span>.

I asked for a wine list, which she <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze6"> pulled out of her <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze7"> apron </span> </span> ! (I don't know why she didn't <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze8"> offer it to me to begin with </span>.) I showed her the chardonnay so she ’d <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze9"> know what I wanted </span> and she <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze10"> went off to get our drinks </span>.... She <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze11"> said it was a just like a beef vegetable soup </span>.... Finally she <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze12"> arrived with his soup and my wine </span>. My date <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze13"> reminded her of the beer </span> and she <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze14"> apologized </span> and <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze15"> went to get it </span>.

She was literally <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze19"> inches </span> from him where he was sitting ! I moved back quickly and she <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze20"> sat the beer on the table </span> and <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze21"> walked away </span>. You would think she would have <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze22"> just sat down the beer </span>, or <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze23"> took a walk around to give us a second </span> or at least cleared her <span class="cloze document098 chain6 cloze24"> throat or something </span> … not just watch until we were done !

<div class="chain document098 chain7"><p>... The food was <span class="cloze document098 chain7 cloze0"> great </span> but the service was something else altogether....

You would think she would have just sat down the beer, or took a walk around to give us a second or at least cleared her throat or something … not just watch until we were done !... </p></div>

<div class="chain document098 chain9"><p>... My date ordered steak, but he doesn't <span class="cloze document098 chain9 cloze0"> like salad so he <span class="cloze document098 chain9 cloze1"> asked about the soups ; specifically the "Steak Soup </span> </span>."... (He <span class="cloze document098 chain9 cloze2"> ordered it </span> … it was a thick beef stew !) Finally she arrived with his <span class="cloze document098 chain9 cloze3"> soup </span> and my wine.... While she was gone, he <span class="cloze document098 chain9 cloze4"> leaned over to give me a kiss </span>.... I opened my eyes to see her just standing at our table, basically watching us, with his <span class="cloze document098 chain9 cloze5"> beer </span> in her hand … smiling. She was literally inches from him where he was <span class="cloze document098 chain9 cloze6"> sitting </span> !... </p></div>

<div class="chain document098 chain10"><p>... So I replied that I would just <span class="cloze document098 chain10 cloze0"> have a chardonnay … any kind </span>.... I <span class="cloze document098 chain10 cloze1"> showed her the chardonnay so she ’d know what I wanted </span> and she went off to get our drinks.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document098 chain11"><p>... My date and I <span class="cloze document098 chain11 cloze0"> laughed a bit … in a good mood </span> and not <span class="cloze document098 chain11 cloze1"> easily annoyed </span>.... My date <span class="cloze document098 chain11 cloze2"> ordered steak </span>, but he doesn't like salad so he asked about the soups ; specifically the "Steak Soup."... My date <span class="cloze document098 chain11 cloze3"> reminded her of the beer </span> and she apologized and went to get it.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document098 chain12"><p>... She said she didn't know anything about wine so she had no idea if they <span class="cloze document098 chain12 cloze0"> had it </span>.... (I don't know why she didn't <span class="cloze document098 chain12 cloze1"> offer it to me to begin with </span>.)... </p></div>

<div class="chain document098 chain13"><p>... Fortunately our mood really could not be <span class="cloze document098 chain13 cloze0"> ruined </span> and we just <span class="cloze document098 chain13 cloze1"> laughed it off as her probably being new </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document098 chain14"><p> In October 2010, I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze0"> drove 300 miles to spend the weekend with my <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze1"> first love </span> from high school, 26 years later (we had recently reunited after not seeing each other for over 20 years) </span>. I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze2"> met him at the hotel </span> and we left for dinner in his car.... My <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze3"> (now) fiance </span> <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze4"> ordered a commonly known beer and I </span> asked if they had a riesling. My <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze5"> question </span> was met by a blank stare. I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze6"> said, "It's wine </span>."... So I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze7"> replied that I would just <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze8"> have a chardonnay … any kind </span> </span>.... Anyway, I again <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze9"> told her it was wine </span>.... I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze10"> asked for a wine list, which she pulled out of her apron </span> ! (I don't <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze11"> know why she didn't offer it to me to begin with </span>.) I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze12"> showed her the chardonnay so she ’d know what I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze13"> wanted </span> </span> and she went off to get our drinks. My <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze14"> date </span> and I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze15"> laughed a bit … in a good mood </span> and not easily annoyed. Then came time to order our food … we still didn't have our drinks … I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze16"> ordered one of their salads </span>. My <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze17"> date </span> ordered steak, but he doesn't like salad so he asked about the soups ; specifically the "Steak Soup."... Finally she arrived with his soup and my <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze18"> wine </span>. My <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze19"> date </span> reminded her of the beer and she apologized and went to get it. While she was gone, he leaned over to give me a kiss.... I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze20"> opened my <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze21"> eyes </span> to see her just standing at our table, basically watching us, with his beer in her hand </span> … smiling.... I <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze22"> moved back quickly </span> and she sat the beer on the table and walked away.... We finally flagged her down to get another beer for my <span class="cloze document098 chain14 cloze23"> fiance </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document099 chain0"><p>... They <span class="cloze document099 chain0 cloze0"> quoted us a time of about an hour </span> and we were fine with that and we had snacks.... Finally we called the pizza place (after almost two hours) and they <span class="cloze document099 chain0 cloze1"> assured us it was on its way </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document099 chain1"><p> This experience happened about a week ago when my family decided to <span class="cloze document099 chain1 cloze0"> order a pizza for dinner </span>. The pizza place was <span class="cloze document099 chain1 cloze1"> a small deep-dish restaurant </span> that also delivered. We love deep-dish pizza and we knew it would be about <span class="cloze document099 chain1 cloze2"> 35-45 minutes </span> until it was <span class="cloze document099 chain1 cloze3"> done </span>.... Finally we <span class="cloze document099 chain1 cloze4"> called the pizza place (after almost two hours) </span> and they assured us it was on its way.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document099 chain2"><p>... We <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze0"> love deep-dish pizza </span> and we <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze1"> knew it would be about 35-45 minutes until it was done </span>. They <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze2"> quoted us a time of about an hour </span> and we were <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze3"> fine with that </span> and we <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze4"> had snacks </span>. An hour went by and we <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze5"> continued to wait </span>.... Finally we <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze6"> called the pizza place (after almost two hours) </span> and they <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze7"> assured us it was on its way </span>. So we <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze8"> waited some more </span>. Finally after 45 minutes we <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze9"> called back </span>.... By then it was 9:30 and we were <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze10"> hungry </span>. They had to remake our <span class="cloze document099 chain2 cloze11"> pizza </span>, and it was going to take another hour before it arrived.... They sent us a gift card and a bottle of wine, but it was still a bad experience. </p></div>

<div class="chain document099 chain3"><p>... They had to remake our pizza, and it was <span class="cloze document099 chain3 cloze0"> going to take another hour before it <span class="cloze document099 chain3 cloze1"> arrived </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document099 chain4"><p> This experience happened about a week ago when my <span class="cloze document099 chain4 cloze0"> family </span> decided to order a pizza for dinner.... My <span class="cloze document099 chain4 cloze1"> brother </span> had to wake up early for a standardized test and did not want to be going to bed late. I <span class="cloze document099 chain4 cloze2"> understand accidents happen </span>, but waiting three hours for a pizza was ridiculous.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document099 chain5"><p>... Finally we called the pizza place (after almost two hours) and they assured us it was on <span class="cloze document099 chain5 cloze0"> its <span class="cloze document099 chain5 cloze1"> way </span> </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document099 chain6"><p>... The delivery guy had <span class="cloze document099 chain6 cloze0"> gotten locked out of his <span class="cloze document099 chain6 cloze1"> car </span> with the pizzas in it </span>.... </p></div>

<div class="chain document099 chain7"><p>... They <span class="cloze document099 chain7 cloze0"> had to remake our pizza </span>, and it was going to take another hour before it arrived.... They <span class="cloze document099 chain7 cloze1"> sent us a gift card and a bottle of wine </span>, but it was still a bad experience. </p></div>
