# Experiment 1: Narrative cloze task

## How do people score on a narrative cloze task?

1. Reduce original and human response to just the head word of the cloze phrase. How often do people's responses match the original (%match/cloze)? Do people tend to agree with one another (entropy/cloze)?

## How does the model score on that narrative cloze task relative to people (%match)? Is the model uncertain/variable on the same tasks as people (entropy)?

## How does the model's score on the narrative cloze task change when the gold standard is the original text vs. people's answers (%match).

## Notes

* People were given a different narrative cloze task than the model was given. We presented people with the full text of the chain, with the full event phrase left blank for them to fill in. The model was given those chains, but pared down to the head word for each event. Evaluation for both people and model was based on what head word they chose to fill in for the event.
