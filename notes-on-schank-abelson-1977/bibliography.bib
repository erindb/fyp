	abstract = {Many theories of memory incorporate the notion of retrieval interference, which says that facts learned about the same concept can interfere with one another during retrieval. This notion implies that the more facts learned about a concept the greater the retrieval interference. But this makes it paradoxical how one ever becomes knowledgeable about a topic. To resolve this paradox, we argue that one can overcome interference by using relevant world knowledge to integrate various facts learned about a concept.

Three experiments demonstrate that integration can overcome interference. All used a recognition paradigm developed by Anderson and Bower 1973. Subjects first memorized a set of facts about particular people (e.g., Marly, the banker), and then decided whether or not test sentences were from the memorized set. Experiments 1 and 2 manipulated (a) the number of facts learned about a particular person and (b) whether or not they were integrated. With unintegrated facts, the time to recognize a test sentence increased with the number of facts learned about the person mentioned in that sentence; with integrated facts, no such increase was found. Experiment 3 further showed that subjects had difficulty rejecting distractors that were thematically related to integrated facts. To account for these effects, two hypotheses were considered, one an alteration of Anderson and Bower's HAM model, and the other an elaboration of Schank and Abelson's 1977 script analysis.},

After discussing our general framework for investigating memory, we examined story grammars considered as theories of readers' memory of a story. Story grammars were found to be inadequate as grammars, as recognition devices for stories, and as predictors of recall probabilities of different statements in three test stories. An alternative approach views a story as a problem-solving protocol and analyzes it into a hierarchical state transition (HST) network; actions were viewed as succeeding or failing to bring about state changes, with actions perhaps being decomposed into subactions. We hypothesized that successful actions, and those higher in the action hierarchy, would be remembered better. Recall evidence supported these hypotheses. First, they predicted recall of statements within our three test stories. Second, people recalled action sequences that were completed, or that succeeded in attaining a goal, better than ones that were begun but abandoned before completion or because they failed. Third, superordinate actions were recalled more than subordinate ones. Fourth, setting information that enabled plot actions was recalled more than unused setting information; moreover, used settings tended to be misrecalled near actions they enabled. Finally we discussed incompletenesses of the HST approach. It requires a processing theory. We suggested some of its components and some story phenomena it must encompass.},

A schema is a cluster of knowledge that describes the typical properties of the concept it represents. Recent theories built upon the notion of schemata have explained numerous results in human comprehension, recall, and summarization of prose. While schema theory provides a plausible and descriptive framework for understanding human knowledge processing, it is ill-constrained and provides few detailed process assumptions. This lack of constraint allows sufficient flexibility to accommodate post hoc many empirical results. However, because of this flexibility, the theory is of limited predictive value and is not testable as a scientific theory in its current form. We detail the strengths and weaknesses of schema theory, affirm its promise as a theory of human memory, and suggest areas for future theoretical development.},

These different distances were reflected in different amounts of priming between words in Experiment 1 and between sentences in Experiment 2. When a test item (word or sentence) was immediately preceded in a list of test items by an item close in meaning structure, response time was faster than when the preceding item was farther away in meaning structure.

As a possible explanation of the data, it was suggested that scripts be treated as cognitive cuing structures. In this approach instantiated script events can act as recall cues for the usual information presented in the text. Also, the notion of the band width of a cuing structure indicates the range of information upon which the structure can operate. In addition, it was found that scripts do not cluster information during recall as do taxonomic categories.

Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that centrality, but not sequence, influenced time to decide whether an episode belongs to a routine. In Experiment 4, sequence alone affected decisions about which of two episodes occurred earlier; however, the sequence effect was opposite that predicted by script theory.

It is proposed that autobiographical events are organized in memory by the knowledge structures that guided comprehension and planning during the experience. Individual experiences are retrieved from memory by first accessing the knowledge structures used to encode the event, then using information in those structures to predict features of the target event, thus directing search to paths likely to lead to that event. Two types of structures are investigated as candidates for these organizing contexts. Activities are sequences of actions performed to achieve a goal, while general actions are situation-free components occurring as part of several activities and represent what is common to that action across those activities. It is predicted that activities are more important in retrieving experiences, because (1) these structures constitute the principal contexts used to store experiences and (2) information contained within these structures is more useful for predicting features of target events. The greater utility of activities in retrieving experiences was demonstrated in two autobiographical memory retrieval time experiments. First, retrieval of a personal experience matching an activity and action combination was faster when subjects were given an activity cue before a general action cue, because processing could get a “head start” when the activity context was presented first. Second, specifying an activity and action led to faster memory retrievals than specifying only the action, while no such facilitation occurred when an activity was augmented by a general action. In both experiments, retrieval was slowed when more processing was required to infer probable features of the target experience, as predicted by the directed nature of the search process. These experiments and this model provide a general framework for studying the organization of events in autobiographical memory.},

They use this knowledge in making inferences that help them to fill in gaps found in narratives or predict information to follow. The memory representation of common events was investigated by studying the pattern of inferences people make when they read descriptions of these events. People always made inferences that generalized the information presented. When a detail was presented, a more general concept of which it was a part was inferred. Readers often inferred items at the level of abstraction corresponding to scene headers when a sentence embodying a more abstract concept was stated. These results indicated that scripted events are represented in memory as hierarchically and temporally organized information packets. The connections between packets in the network are arranged in such a way that useful generalizations and predictions are available to aid people in understanding events.},

A clear-cut pattern of facilitation for associated script words was demonstrated in Experiment 1 and replicated in Experiments 2 and 3. In Experiments 2 and 3 this facilitation was shown to be robust with respect to intervening materials up to three sentences long. The results from Experiment 3 also suggest that the influence of script contexts does not simply decay over time since last mention; rather it is deactivated by control cues in a text. Further, the findings from Experiment 4 imply that under certain circumstances at least two scripts may be active at the same time. It is argued that script contexts could be useful for incorporating word recognition research with research on text comprehension. An associative network account of the findings is given.},

This theoretical position was supported in three experiments which examined encoding processes, the cognitive products, and retrieval processes of the verbatim, propositional, and situational processing components: The degree of propositional and situational processing was successfully manipulated by varying the subjects' study goals. As a consequence of these differential encoding processes, subjects who studied for text summarization remembered more propositional information while subjects with a knowledge acquisition goal remembered more situational information. It was found that the situational encoding and retrieval processes proceeded faster than the respective propositional processes. In a sentence recognition task, subjects more strongly relied upon situational than propositional information, demonstrating the importance of situational representations in text comprehension.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with some of the factors that determine the difficulty of material that needs to be learned. It is suggested that when considering intellectual activities, schema acquisition and automation are the primary mechanisms of learning. The consequences of cognitive load theory for the structuring of information in order to reduce difficulty by focusing cognitive activity on schema acquisition is briefly summarized. It is pointed out that cognitive load theory deals with learning and problem solving difficulty that is artificial in that it can be manipulated by instructional design. Intrinsic cognitive load in contrast, is constant for a given area because it is a basic component of the material. Intrinsic cognitive load is characterized in terms of element interactivity. The elements of most schemas must be learned simultaneously because they interact and it is the interaction that is critical. If, as in some areas, interactions between many elements must be learned, then intrinsic cognitive load will be high. In contrast, in different areas, if elements can be learned successively rather than simultaneously because they do not interact, intrinsic cognitive load will be low. It is suggested that extraneous cognitive load that interferes with learning only is a problem under conditions of high cognitive load caused by high element interactivity. Under conditions of low element interactivity, re-designing instruction to reduce extraneous cognitive load may have no appreciable consequences. In addition, the concept of element interactivity can be used to explain not only why some material is difficult to learn but also, why it can be difficult to understand. Understanding becomes relevant when high element interactivity material with a naturally high cognitive load must be learned.},

We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them.},

Ambiguous terminology hinders cross-study comparisons and confounds interpretation of the suggested role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in schema functions. Based on an extensive review of the psychological literature, we propose a framework for distinguishing memory schemas from other knowledge structures. The framework includes a definition of schema as possessing four necessary and sufficient features, and four additional features schemas are sensitive to, which are not required but do play a frequent and central role in schema functions. Necessary schema features are (1) an associative network structure, (2) basis on multiple episodes, (3) lack of unit detail, and (4) adaptability. Features schemas are sensitive to are (5) chronological relationships, (6) hierarchical organization, (7) cross-connectivity, and (8) embedded response options. Additionally, we suggest that vmPFC activity observed in studies of schemas corresponds with participants' coordination of existing schemas with ongoing task demands.},

	abstract = {Scripts that store knowledge of everyday events are fundamentally important for managing daily routines. Content event knowledge (i.e., knowledge about which events belong to a script) and temporal event knowledge (i.e., knowledge about the chronological order of events in a script) constitute qualitatively different forms of knowledge. However, there is limited information about each distinct process and the time course involved in accessing content and temporal event knowledge. Therefore, we analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to either correctly presented event sequences or event sequences that contained a content or temporal error. We found an N400, which was followed by a posteriorly distributed P600 in response to content errors in event sequences. By contrast, we did not find an N400 but an anteriorly distributed P600 in response to temporal errors in event sequences. Thus, the N400 seems to be elicited as a response to a general mismatch between an event and the established event model. We assume that the expectancy violation of content event knowledge, as indicated by the N400, induces the collapse of the established event model, a process indicated by the posterior P600. The expectancy violation of temporal event knowledge is assumed to induce an attempt to reorganize the event model in working memory, a process indicated by the frontal P600.},
