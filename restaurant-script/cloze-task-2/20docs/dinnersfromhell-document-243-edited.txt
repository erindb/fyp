Back in the 70s my college roommate (whom I’ll call “Clark”) and I decided to eat at a nationally-known seafood restaurant. After perusing our menus, the waitress came over to take our order. After giving her my order, she then asked Clark for his. Clark attempted to give his order, but his speech was too slurred to understand what he was saying. The waitress gave me a dirty look and said she’d come back in a few minutes.
I walked away from the table and went to the restroom. I returned to the dining room just in time to see Clark stumble on top of someone’s table, spilling food and drink. The poor diners quickly stood up shouting, “Oh, my God!” The manager, seeing what happened, told someone to call the police. I briskly walked to my car and drove away.
About an hour later Clark came stumbling into our apartment, followed by a woman. She said she was a waitress in the restaurant who happened to know Clark, and that she told the manager she’d drive him home and not to call the police.
