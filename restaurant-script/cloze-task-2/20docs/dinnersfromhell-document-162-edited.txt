I went to a Thai restaurant and ordered Panang Curry with white rice and chicken. What I was served was not chicken. It was slimy, gray, and very chewy. Iâ€™m pretty sure I was served rat. I ate one bite and spit it up. I was too embarrassed to tell the waitress what I thought, so I asked for a to-go box and told her I had to leave for an emergency. I was sick for the next two days!
