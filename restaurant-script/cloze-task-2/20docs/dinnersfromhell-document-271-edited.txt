My wife and I were long looking forward to a romantic Valentine’s Day dinner at a fancy Italian restaurant in Tampa. We were promptly seated at a candlelit table that had been reserved for us. As we reviewed the menus, a tuxedo-clad waiter came to our table and asked if we were ready to order. I told him that we were just given our menus, and that we planned to take our time for the special occasion. Sporting a slight curl in one of his lips, the waiter said in a haughty tone that we only had an hour to spend at the table since another party was due to arrive at that time. My wife and I looked at each other in astonishment as he brusquely walked away from our table. I found the maitre d’ and told him about the rudeness, and how much the special occasion meant to us. He said the waiter was new, and that he’d speak with him.
The waiter said nothing the rest of the evening about us having to leave early, but he was clearly peeved. Just to spite him, we remained at our table for nearly 3 hours. I usually tip well, but I gave the waiter 12%, which actually was too much. If I spend my money and my time at a restaurant, I expect to have an enjoyable experience, especially with my wife on Valentine’s Day.
