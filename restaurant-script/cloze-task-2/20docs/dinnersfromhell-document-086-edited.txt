About two years ago I was dining at an Asian restaurant in San Antonio with my mother and younger brother. The food was delicious but a few things bothered me. First, the waitress stood right by our table the entire time and never left our side. That was nice when it came to requesting refills, but then there comes the second oddity. The waitress offered to refill my mother and brother’s glasses, but she never asked if I needed one. I always had to speak up and try to get her attention for a refill. This definitely wasn’t a super terrible experience, but it did leave me feeling slightly odd afterwards.
