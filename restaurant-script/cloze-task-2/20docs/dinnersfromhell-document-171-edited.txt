I work as a kitchen assistant at a restaurant and I feel compelled to tell this story of what happened to my boss. He works both as the restaurant’s manager and host, so he has to meet everyone that comes in and show them their seats. I feel sorry for him as he has to deal with many stupid and arrogant customers, but when he told me this story I was shocked.
It happened on a bank holiday and I was not at work that day. It was also pouring with rain outside and the restaurant was very busy with only about two tables free. A snooty businessman came in and asked my boss for a table for ten people! He clearly did not notice the busy atmosphere. Anyway, my boss explains that they do not have any room for that amount of people. But this snooty bootie does not take no for an answer. The following argument went like this.
CUSTOMER:  But I can see some tables free over there.
BOSS:  Yes but there is still no room.
CUSTOMER:  Well can’t you join them up together or something?
BOSS:  There is no room to put all those tables together sir.
CUSTOMER:  But there is plenty of room here!
He points to the space that the staff need to use to move from the restaurant to the kitchen doors.
BOSS:  I’m sorry sir but the staff need that space to get to and from the kitchen.
CUSTOMER:  But there is plenty of room!
BOSS:  Sir if you all sat there, you would be blocking the other customers and staff and have food spilled all over you. I’m sorry sir but what you are asking is just not possible.
CUSTOMER:  Well where else am I supposed to go then?
BOSS:  Well sir on a rainy bank holiday, there are only two other restaurants I can suggest to fit in ten people, McDonald’s and KFC!
CUSTOMER:  I WANT REAL FOOD!
I d0n’t know how it finished but there is absolutely no excuse for the way this snobbish son of b**** treated my boss.
