I went to my favorite Vietnamese restaurant as I typically do when I’m in Maryland. It was off to a bad start as soon as I walked in the door. It’s freezing this time of year so I didn’t want to sit near the door. I asked to sit in a booth and was told that somebody was already sitting there. No biggie. I sat elsewhere and waited for a waiter to take my order.
I was waiting about ten minutes in a pretty empty restaurant and noticed that no one had sat in the booth. The waiter finally came and took my order and still no one sat in the booth.
My food came and that’s when it really got weird. In the middle of eating from my clay hot pot, the waiter came over to check how everything was. He proceeded to STIR MY HOT POT to verify the food was fully cooked. WTF? He explained that you know the chicken hot pot is fully cooked when the rice was crispy. At that point he also mentioned that the boss likes to sit at the booth I asked to sit in and that’s why I couldn’t sit there. All while stirring my hot pot.
I lost my appetite and asked for the check. I think I’m taking a break from there for a while.
