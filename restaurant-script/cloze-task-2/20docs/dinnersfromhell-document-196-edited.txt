I was dining at a restaurant on Cape Cod. One of the items on the menu was a 10 oz steak. There was a couple at the next table, and when their dinner was brought to the table, the man complained to the waiter that his steak was too small. The waiter assured the man that the steak was indeed a 10 oz steak, and the man insisted that it wasn’t. After a few rounds of this argument, the waiter went to get the manager. The manager explained to the man that 10 oz was the uncooked weight of the steak. But the man insisted that his steak was too small to even have been 10 oz before cooking. The discussion got a little bit heated, to where both parties were talking loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear.
At this point, the manager turned heel and stalked back into the kitchen. A few minutes later, he returned carrying a box and a food scale. He put the box and the scale down on their table, and proceeded to pull raw steaks out of the box. One after another. Each time, he took a steak out of the box, he threw it on the scale, pointed, and yelled: “10 ounces!”. He then would throw that steak on the table, get another one out of the box, throw it on the scale, and again, exclaim: “10 ounces!”. After the 10 steaks had been so weighed the diner told the manager that he’d had enough of his bad behavior and the couple left. The manager shouted after them that they had not paid their bill, and the man shouted back something that I can’t repeat on a family site. It did add some significant entertainment to our meal, but I decided against having the steak.
