I am a server in a Mexican restaurant. We have a night where our enchilada plates are half price, so we do not allow coupons on the enchilada dinners. I misunderstood my manager and thought that we didn’t accept them at all on that night.
I got a nine top around 9:00. I had the older lady and her husband before. When it came time for the checks, they all wanted to use a coupon. I stated that we didn’t accept coupons on that night due to the special. I tried to explain to them that I was just doing my job correctly.
The older lady interrupted me and raised her voice to me. I interrupted her stating, “I will go get my manager,” and walked away. Her grandson yelled after me wanting to know why I walked away.
I went and got my manager and explained to him what happened. I told him when the lady raised her voice to me, I did walk away. Well, she raised her voice to my manager when he got to the table. He took everything off their bills except drinks and appetizer. He told her and her husband that he didn’t appreciate their rude treatment of his staff, which happened every time they came in. He told them they were no longer welcome.
I may be a server, but if I am being polite to you, do not raise your voice at me. I do my best to do my job to make you happy, but I will not go against the rules my manager has so you can save a buck or two. If you are rude to me, I will walk away.
