I once decided to treat myself to a meal out at a local fast food joint. As I was queuing up, I kept thinking to myself that I had forgotten to do something before eating out. I shook it off and finally reached the counter where a rather bad tempered looking lad was waiting for me. I ordered a fairly simple meal, and it was only when I opened my wallet that I suddenly realised I had forgotten to go to the bank. It was a good thing that they didn’t prepare my meal before giving me the price!
Trying not to let anyone hear, I quietly told the lad to cancel my order. But he scowls and practically yells, “YOU’VE GOT NO MONEY?!'” Everyone started staring at me. I was so embarrassed I wanted the world to open up and swallow me whole. Cringing, I left and went to another restaurant after I had been to the bank as I was too humiliated to go back there.
