On Saturday the 13th of March, my wife and I went into O’C’s located in Avon, Indiana. We were greeted cordially and seated promptly. After sitting in the booth for a while, we noticed ants crawling on us and the table. We also noticed ants crawling along the window sill. We informed the waiter who promptly found us a new table and apologized for the ants.
After we were relocated, we placed our order. We ordered our drinks and a quesadilla appetizer. Drinks were delivered and we placed our order for our dinners. The salads with the dinners were delivered before the appetizer we ordered. Halfway through eating my salad, I noticed the lettuce being real dry in my mouth. I pulled the lettuce out to find a tissue. A tissue that people use to blow their noses was mixed into my salad! If the tissue was used or not I do not know. At that time I was so mad I yelled at the waiter. He said he apologized and would go and get the manager. I replied forget getting the manager… we are done here! This is disgusting I said.
We started on our way out of the restaurant. The manager was following us. I spoke with him and all he could really do is apologize for the situation. At that time apologies were just not good enough. I was furious. And I am still very upset with the situation. I am also sending a report to the Local Health department and BBB. Things like this should never, NEVER, happen in a business. Our experience at that restaurant was a disgusting and unhealthy one.
