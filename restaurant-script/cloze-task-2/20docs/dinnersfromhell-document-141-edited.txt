My mother and I once went to Edinburgh in Scotland for a trip and stopped by to eat at a friendly looking restaurant. It was almost deserted as night had set in. However there was a scruffy, shifty and downright scary gentleman sitting just a few tables away from us. You could tell he was quite sloshed as he had a pint in his hand. He kept glaring at everyone as if they had insulted him.
After a while he got up and started to wander around the place occasionally saying out loud some drunken garble. Luckily a member of staff was keeping a close eye on him. He suddenly turned to me and my mother and I was petrified he was going to come up to us. However he just stood there at his table staring at us with a hateful look on him. By now he was hunched forward and unsteady on his feet. We left as soon as we were done, gave the staff a nice tip for the great food and walked out with the creepy man still staring at us.
