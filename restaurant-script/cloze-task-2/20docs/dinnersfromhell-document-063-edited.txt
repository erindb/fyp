First you have to understand that I like bloody, rare burgers. When dining out, if I want a burger I will always ask the server if the place does rare and if not I will order something else. I am also not usually shy about sending something back if it is not cooked right.
My wife and I had spent the day at a beach/tourist place and decided to have dinner before the relatively long drive home. I did the whole “Do you serve rare burgers?” thing and was assured they do. It was a long day and I was tired, so I mentioned to my wife that I really didn’t care if the burger was overcooked, I just wanted to eat and hit the road.
Meals are dropped off, I check the burger and it is not only well done it is hard as a rock. A few seconds later the server came to check on us and asked how our food was. I said fine but my wife (I don’t know why) decided to say, “You know his burger is really well done.”
The server started arguing with my wife, “I made sure the cook knew it had to be rare… the cook was going to leave it on longer but I made him take it off… etc.” After a minute or so of listening to them argue about whether the burger was well done or rare, I just picked the burger patty up with both hands, they both stopped and looked at me, and I broke the burger patty in half with an audible snap.
The look on the server’s face was priceless. She apologized and offered to have it re-made. I told her it was fine and I really just wanted to eat and get going.
I know the server shouldn’t have argued (even if she hadn’t been in the wrong), but I wasn’t exactly happy that my wife had started it, and the whole bit with snapping the burger patty in half was amusing (I’m still amused by it today), so I left a 20% tip.
