A federal judge walks into a restaurant with a martini… Wait, that’s not a joke, that happened the other night. Not only is it a violation of my liquor license, it’s just gauche.
I’m a manager and tried to unobtrusively and politely pull the drink without causing a scene, all while explaining that it was a violation of our liquor license and I couldn’t allow this guest to keep the martini he had dumped into his wine glass. This is the email we got:
“We had a very nice dinner Wednesday night celebrating our 36th anniversary. But I thought you would like to know that the manager was extremely rude to us. We exited the limo and our best man had not finished his martini. So he carried it into the restaurant. The hostess said she would have to speak to the manager. He stormed over to the table and scooped up the drink with nary a word. Our friend was no ordinary scofflaw but a federal judge who has just lost his wife. Most restaurants allow wine to be brought in. I think this could have been handled in a more gracious fashion. As I said, we did not allow it to tarnish our evening. Thought you would want to know.”
In reality this “judge” was trying to hide his martini on the floor. If anyone should know better, you’d think it was him, except for his sense of entitlement.
