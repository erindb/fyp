  <p>We are interested in what knowledge people have about restaurants. You will see a series of very short stories that took place at a restaurant. For each story, one event will be left blank. Please fill in the blank with whatever you feel would likely and plausible. Completions should be short phrases.</p>
  <p>Most questions will likely have multiple reasonable responses. Please respond with your first impression of a plausible completion.</p>
  <p>Sometimes we will take only an excerpt from the original story. If we skip some information, we will indicate this with "...".</p>
